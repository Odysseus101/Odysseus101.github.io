                MEETING AMONG THE PRESIDENT, JOHN
                DEAN, AND H.R. HALDEMAN IN THE OVAL
                OFFICE, ON MARCH 21, 1973, FROM
                10:12 TO 11:55 AM</b><br><br>
                PRESIDENT: John, sit down, sit down.
                DEAN: Good morning.
                PRESIDENT: Well, what is the Dean summary of the day
                about?
                DEAN: John caught me on the way out and asked me
                about why Gray was holding back on
                information, if that was under instructions
                from us. And it, uh, it was and it wasn't.
                Uh, it was instructions proposed by the
                Attorney General, consistent with your press
                conference statement that no further raw
                data was to be turned over to the...
                PRESIDENT: Full committee.
                DEAN: ...full committee.
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: And that was the extent of it. And Gray,
                himself, is the one who reached the
                conclusion that no more information be
                turned over; he'd turned over enough. Uh,
                so this is again Pat Gray making decisions
                on his own as to how to handle his hearings.
                He has been totally unwilling all along to
                take any guidance, any instruction. We
                don't know what he is going to do. He is
                not going to talk about it. He won't review
                it, uh, and I don't think...
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 2
                DEAN: ...he does it to harm you in any way, sir.
                PRESIDENT: He's just quite stubborn and -- he's quite
                stubborn; also he isn't very smart. You
                know he and I--
                DEAN: He's bullheaded.
                PRESIDENT: He's smart in his own way, but...
                DEAN: Yeah.
                PRESIDENT: ...but he's got that typical, "Well, by God,
                this is right and they're not going to do
                it."
                DEAN: That's why he thinks he'll be confirmed,
                because he thinks he's being, he's being his
                own man He's being forthright, honest. He's
                feels he has turned over too much and so
                it's a conscious decision that he is harming
                the Bureau by doing this and so he's not
                going to--
                PRESIDENT: (Sighs) I hope to God that we can get off
                (unintelligible) though today, this is
                because the White House told him to do this
                and that other thing. And also, I told
                Ehrlichman, I don't see why our little boys
                can't make something out of the fact that,
                God darn it, this is the, this is the, the
                only responsible decision you could possibly
                make. The FBI cannot turn over raw files.
                Has anybody made that point? I've tried...
                MARCH 21, 1973 -FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 3
                DEAN: Sam Ervin has made that point himself.
                PRESIDENT: Did he?
                DEAN: Uh, in fact, in reading the transcript of
                Gray's hearings, Ervin tried to hold Gray
                back from doing what he was doing at the
                time he did it. Uh, I thought it was very
                unwise. I don't think that anyone is
                criticizing...
                PRESIDENT: Well, let's say --
                DEAN: ... your position on it.
                PRESIDENT: Let's make the point, let's make the point
                that the raw files cannot be turned over.
                Well, I think that point should be made.
                DEAN: That, that--
                PRESIDENT: (Background noises) We are standing for the
                rights of innocent individuals. The
                American Civil Liberty Union is against it.
                We're against it. (Unintelligible)
                tradition, and it will continue to be the
                tradition that all files are -- I'd like to
                turn them (Unintelligible) let them see what
                is in one.
                DEAN: How damaging--
                PRESIDENT: Any further word on, on Sullivan? Is he
                still--
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 4
                DEAN: Yeah, he's, he's going to be over to see me
                today, this morning, hopefully, some-time.
                Uh--
                PRESIDENT: As soon as you get that, I'll be available
                to talk to you this afternoon.
                DEAN: All right, sir.
                PRESIDENT: I'll be busy until about one o'clock; after
                that we can contact. Anytime you're through
                I would like to see whatever thing he has.
                Well, he' 5 got something, but I'd like-to
                just see what it is.
                DEAN: Uh, the reason I thought we ought to talk
                this morning is because in, in our
                conversations, uh, uh, I have, I have the
                impression that you don't know everything I
                know
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: ...and it makes it very difficult for you to
                make judgments that, uh, that only you can
                make...
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: ... on some of these things and I thought
                that--
                PRESIDENT: You've got, in other words, I've got to know
                why you feel that, uh, that something...
                DEAN: Well, let me...
                PRESIDENT: ...that, that we shouldn't unravel
                something.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 5
                DEAN: ...let me give you my overall first.
                PRESIDENT: In other words, you, your judgment as to
                where it stands, and where we go now---
                DEAN: I think, I think that, uh, there's no doubt
                about the seriousness of the problem we're,
                we've got. We have a cancer--within, close
                to the Presidency, that's growing. It's
                growing daily. It's compounding, it grows
                geometrically now because it compounds
                itself. Uh, that'll be clear as I explain
                you know, some of the details, uh, of why it
                is, and it basically is because (1) we're
                being blackmailed; (2) uh, people are going
                to start perjuring themself very quickly
                that have not had to perjure themselves to
                protect other people and the like. And that
                is just--and there is no assurance--
                PRESIDENT: That it won't bust.
                DEAN: That, that won't bust.
                PRESIDENT: True.
                DEAN: So, let me give you the sort of basic facts'
                talking first about the Watergate; and then
                about Segretti; and then about some of the
                peripheral items that, uh, have come up.
                First of all, on, on the Watergate: How did
                it all start, where did it start? It
                started with an instruction to me from Bob
                Haldeman to see if we couldn't set up a
                perfectly legitimate campaign intelligence
                operation over at the Re-election Committee.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 6
                PRESIDENT: Hmm.
                DEAN: Not being in this business, I turned to
                somebody who had been in this business, Jack
                Caulfield, who is, I don't know if you
                remember Jack or not. He was your original
                bodyguard before
                PRES IDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...they had...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...candidate, candidate...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...protection, an old New York City
                policeman.
                PRESIDENT: Right, I know, I know him.
                DEAN: Uh, Jack had worked for John and then was
                transferred to my office. I said, "Jack,
                come up with a plan that, you know, is a
                normal infiltration, I mean, you know,
                buying informa- tion from secretaries and
                all that sort of thing." He did, he put
                together a plan. It was kicked around, and,
                uh, I went to Ehrlichman with it. I went to
                Mitchell with it, and the consensus was that
                Caulfield wasn't the man to do this. Uh, in
                retrospect, that might have been a bad call,
                'cause he is an incredibly cautious person
                and, and wouldn't have put the situation to
                where it is today.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 7
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: All right, after rejecting that, they said,
                "We still need something," so I was told to
                look around for somebody that could go over
                to 1701 and do this. And that's when I came
                up with Gordon Liddy, who-- they needed a
                lawyer. Gordon had an intelligence background from his FBI service. I was aware of
                the fact that he had done some extremely
                sensitive things for the White House while
                he'd been at the White House, and he had
                apparently done them well. Uh, going out
                into Ellsberg's doctor's office...
                PRESIDENT: Oh, yeah.
                DEAN: ... and things like this. He'd worked with
                leaks. He'd, you know, tracked these things
                down. Uh, and (coughs) so the report that I
                got from Krogh was that he was a hell of a
                good man and, and not only that, a good
                lawyer, uh, and could set up a proper
                operation. So we talked to Liddy. Liddy
                was interested in doing it. Took, uh, Liddy
                over to meet Mitchell. Mitchell thought
                highly of him because, apparently, Mitchell
                was partially involved in his ev--coming to
                the White House to work for, for Krogh. Uh,
                Liddy had been at Treasury before that.
                Then Liddy was told to put together his
                plan, you know, how he would run an
                intelligence operation. And this was after
                he was hired over there at the, uh, the
                Committee. Magruder called me in January
                and said, "I'd like to have you come over
                and see Liddy's plan."
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 8
                PRESIDENT: January of '72?
                DEAN: January of '72. (Background noises) Like,
                "You come over to Mitchell's office and sit
                in on a meeting where Liddy is going to lay
                his plan out." I said, "Well, I don't really
                know as I'm the man, but if you want me
                there I'll be happy to." (Clears throat) So,
                I came over and Liddy laid out a million
                dollar plan that was the most incredible
                thing I have ever laid my eyes on. All in
                codes, and involved black bag operations,
                kidnapping, providing prostitutes, uh, to
                weaken the opposition, bugging, uh, mugging
                teams. It was just an incredible thing.
                (Clears throat)
                PRESIDENT: But, uh...
                DEAN: And--
                PRESIDENT: ...that was, that was not, uh...
                DEAN: No.
                PRESIDENT: ...discussed with...
                DEAN: No.
                PRESIDENT: ...other persons.
                DEAN: No, not at all. And--
                PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)
                DEAN: Uh, Mitchell, Mitchell just virtually sat
                there puffing and laughing. I could tell
                'cause after he--after Liddy left the office
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 9
                I said, "That's the most incredible thing
                I've ever seen." He said, " I agree." And so
                then he was told to go back to the draw-ing
                boards and come up with something realistic.
                So there was a second meeting. Uh, they
                asked me to come over to that. I came into
                the tail end of the meeting. I wasn't there
                for the first part. I don't know how long
                the meeting lasted. Uh, at this point, they
                were discussing again bugging, kidnapping
                and the like. And at this point I said,
                right in front of everybody, very clearly, I
                said, "These are not the sort of things (1)
                that are ever to be discussed in the office
                of the Attorney General of the United
                States"--where he still was--"and I am
                personally incensed." I was trying to get
                Mitchell off the hook, uh, 'cause--
                PRESIDENT: I know.
                DEAN: He's a, he's a nice person, doesn't like to
                say no under--when people he's going to have
                to work with.
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: So, I let, I let it be known. I said, "You
                all pack that stuff up and get it the hell
                out of here 'cause we just, you just can't
                talk this way in this office and you
                shouldn't, you shouldn't, you should reexamine your whole thinking." Came back--
                PRESIDENT: Who else was present? Be-, besides you--
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 10
                DEAN: It was Magruder, Magruder--
                PRESIDENT: Magruder.
                DEAN: Uh, Mitchell, Liddy and myself. I came back
                right after the meeting and told Bob, I
                said, "Bob, we've got a growing disaster on
                our hands if they're thinking this way.' and
                I said, "The Unite House has got to stay out
                of this and I, frankly, am not going to be
                involved in it." He said, "I agree John."
                And, I thought, at that point the thing was
                turned off. That's the last I heard of it,
                when I thought it was turned off, because it
                was an absurd proposal.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: Liddy-I did have dealings with him
                afterwards. We never talked about it. Now
                that would be hard to believe for some
                people, but, uh, we never did. Just the
                fact of the matter.
                PRESIDENT: Well, you were talking about other things.
                DEAN: Other things. We had so many other things.
                PRESIDENT: He had some legal problems at one time.
                DEAN: Now (coughs)--
                PRESIDENT: But you were his advisor, and I, I
                understand how you could have some, uh, what
                cam--what are they campaign laws--I knew
                that was you, you have--Haldeman told me
                you, that you were heading all of that up
                for us. Go ahead.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 11
                DEAN: Now. (Clears Throat). So, Liddy went back
                after that and it was over, over at, uh,
                1701, the Committee, and I, this is where I
                come into having put the pieces together
                after the fact as to what I can put together
                what happened. Liddy sat over there and
                tried to come up with another plan that he
                could sell. (1) They were talking, saying
                to him he was asking for too much money, and
                I don't think they were discounting the, the
                illegal points at this, after--you know.
                Jeb is not a lawyer and he didn't know
                whether this was the way the game was played
                or not, and what it was all about. They
                came up with, apparently, another plan, uh,
                but they couldn't get it approved by anybody
                over there. So, Liddy and Hunt apparently
                came to see Chuck Colson, and Chuck Colson
                picked up the telephone and called Magruder
                and said, "You all either fish or cut bait.
                Uh, this is absurd to have these guys over
                there and not using them, and if you're not
                going to use them, I may use them." Things
                of this nature.
                PRESIDENT: When was this?
                DEAN: This was apparently in February of '72.
                PRESIDENT: That could be. Colson know what they were
                talking about?
                DEAN: I can only assume, because of his close
                relation-ship with...
                PRESIDENT: Hunt.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A M. 12
                DEAN: ...Hunt, he had a damn good idea of what
                they were talking about, a damn good idea.
                He would probably deny it, deny it today and
                probably get away with denying it. But I,
                uh, I still--
                PRESIDENT: Unless Hunt--
                DEAN: Unless Hunt, uh, blows on him--
                PRESIDENT: But then Hunt isn't enough. I takes two
                doesn't it?
                DEAN: Probably. Probably. But Liddy was there
                also and if, if Liddy were to blow--
                PRESIDENT: Then you've got a problem--I was thinking
                (unintelligible}the criminal liability goes.
                DEAN: Yeah.
                PRESIDENT: Okay.
                DEAN: I'll go back over that, and tell (noise) you
                where I think the, the soft spots are.
                PRESIDENT: Colson then, then Colson then, do you think
                was the, uh, was the person who...
                DEAN: I think he...
                PRESIDENT: ...pushed?
                MARCH 21 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 13
                DEAN: I think he helped to get the push, get the
                thing off the dime. Now something else
                occurred, though --
                PRESIDENT: Did Colson--did he talk to anybody here?
                DEAN: No. I think this was an independent ...
                PRESIDENT: Did he talk to Haldeman?
                DEAN: No. I don't think so. Now, but here's the
                other thing, where the next thing comes in
                the chain: I think that Bob was assuming
                that they had something that was proper over
                there, some intelligence gathering operation
                that Liddy was operating. And through
                Strachan, uh, who was his tickler, uh, he
                started pushing them
                PRESIDENT: (Sighs) yeah.
                DEAN: ...to get something, to get some information
                and they took that as a signal--Magruder
                took that as a signal to probably go to
                Mitchell and say, "They're pushing us like
                crazy for this from the White House." And so
                Mitchell probably puffed on his pipe and
                said, "Go ahead." And never really reflected
                on what it was all about. So, they had some
                plan that obviously had, I gather, different
                targets they were going to go after. They
                were going to infiltrate, and bug, and do
                all this sort of thing to a lot of these
                targets. This is knowledge I have after the
                fact.(coughs) And,
                MARCH 21 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 14
                apparently, they, uh, they, they had, they
                had after they had initially broken in and
                bugged the Democratic National Committee
                they were getting information. The
                information was coming over here to
                Strachan. Some of it was given to Haldeman.
                Uh, there is no doubt about it. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: Did he know what it was coming from?
                DEAN: I don't really know if he was, sir.
                PRESIDENT: Not necessarily.
                DEAN: Not necessarily. That -- not necessarily.
                Uh--
                PRESIDENT: Strachan knew what it was from.
                DEAN: Strachan knew what it was from. No doubt
                about it, and whether Strachan--I've never
                wanted to press these people on these points
                because it...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...it hurts them to, to give up that next
                inch. So I had to piece things together.
                All right, so, Strachan was aware of
                receiving information, reporting to Bob. At
                one point Bob even gave instructions to
                change their capabilities from Muskie to
                McGovern, and had passed this back through
                Strachan to Magruder and, and apparently to
                Liddy, and Liddy was starting to make
                arrangements to go in and bug the uh, uh,
                McGovern operation. They had done prelim-
                ...
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 15
                PRESIDENT: They had never bugged Muskie, though, did
                they?
                DEAN: No, they hadn't but they had a, they had,
                uh, they'd...
                PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible).
                DEAN: ...infiltrated it by a, a, they had...
                PRESIDENT: A secretary.
                DEAN: ...a secretary and a chauffeur. Nothing
                illegal about that.
                PRESIDENT: I suppose you're--
                DEAN: Now, so the information was coming over here
                and then, uh, I finally, after --the next
                point in time where I became aware of
                anything was on June 17th, when I got word
                that there had been this break-in at the
                Democratic National Committee and somebody
                from the Committee had been caught, uh, from
                our Committee had been caught in the DNC.
                And I said, "Oh, my God, that, I can only",
                you know, if, instantly putting the pieces
                together--(Coughs)
                PRESIDENT: You knew what it was.
                DEAN: I knew what it was. So I called Liddy, uh,
                on that Monday morning, and I said, "Gordon"
                - I said, "first, I want to know if anybodyin the White House was involved in this."
                And he said, "No." And they weren't. I
                said,
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 16
                "Well, I want to know how in God's name-this
                happened." And he said, "Well, I was pushed
                without mercy by Magruder to get in there,
                get more information--that the information,
                it was not satisfactory. Magruder said,
                'The White House is not happy with what
                we're getting."'
                PRESIDENT: The White House?
                DEAN: The White House. Yeah, Uh--
                PRESIDENT: Who do you think was pushing him?
                DEAN: Well, I think it was probably Strachan
                thinking that Bob wanted things,(cough) and
                because because I have seen that happen on
                other occasions where things have been said
                to be Of very prime importance when they
                really weren't.
                PRESIDENT: Why (unintelligible) I wonder? I'm just
                try-ing to think as to why then. We'd just
                finished the Moscow trip. I mean, we were--
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: The Democrats had just nominated Mc G-, Mc
                Govern. I mean, for Christ's sakes, I mean,
                what the hell were we--I mean, I can see
                doing it earlier but I mean, now let me say,
                I can see the pressure, but I don't see why
                all the pressure would have been one then.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 17
                DEAN: I don't know, other than the fact that, uh,
                they might have been looking for information
                about
                PRESIDENT: The convention.
                DEAN: ...the conventions.
                PRESIDENT: Well, that's right.
                DEAN: Because, I understand, also after the fact,
                that there was a plan to bug Larry O'Brien's
                suite down in Florida.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: Uh, so, uh, Liddy told me, that uh, you
                know, this is what had happened and, and
                this is why it had happened.
                PRESIDENT: Liddy told you he was planning--where'd you
                learn there was such a plan--from whom?
                DEAN: Beg your pardon.
                PRESIDENT: Where did you learn of the plans to bug
                Larry O'Brien's suite?
                DEAN: From Magruder, after the, long after the
                fact.
                PRESIDENT: Oh, Magruder, he knows.
                DEAN: Yeah. Magruder is totally knowledgeable on
                the whole thing.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 18
                DEAN: All right, now, we've gone through the
                trial. We've--I don't know if Mitchell has
                perjured himself in the Grand Jury or not.
                I've never--
                PRESIDENT: Who?
                DEAN: Mitchell. I don't know how much knowledge
                he actually had. I know that Magruder has
                perjured himself in the Grand Jury. I know
                that Porter has perjured himself, uh, in the
                Grand Jury.
                PRESIDENT: Porter (Unintelligible).
                DEAN: He's one of Magruder's deputies.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: Uh, that they set up this scenario which
                they ran by me. They said, "How about
                this?" I said, "Well, I don't knot. I, you
                know, if, if this is that you're going to
                hang on, fine." Uh, that they--
                PRESIDENT: What did they say before the Grand Jury?
                DEAN: They said, they said, as they said before
                the trial and the Grand Jury, that, that,
                uh, Liddy had come over as, as a counsel and
                we knell he had these capacities to, you
                knoll, to do legitimate intelligence. We
                had no idea what he was doing. He was given
                an authorization of 250,000 dollars..
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 19
                DEAN: ...to collect information, because our
                surrogates were out on the road. They had
                no protection. We had information that
                there were going to be demonstrations
                against them, that, uh, uh, we had to have a
                plan to get information as to what
                liabilities they were going to be confronted
                with...
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: ...and Liddy was charged with doing this.
                We had no knowledge that he was going to bug
                the ARC. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: Well, the point is, that's untrue.
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: Magruder did know that-- -
                DEAN: Magruder was specifically instructed him to
                go back in the DNC.
                PRESIDENT: He did?
                DEAN: Yes.
                PRESIDENT: You know that? Yeah, I see. Okay.
                DEAN: Uh, (pause)- I honestly believe that noose
                over here knew that. I know, uh, as God is
                my maker, I had no knowledge that they were
                going to do this.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 20
                PRESIDENT: Bob didn't either (unintelligible).
                DEAN: Oh, but, you know, Unintelligible)
                PRESIDENT: (unintelligible) Bob, Bob-- he wouldn't--
                DEAN: Bob I don't believe specifically knew they
                were going in there.
                PRESIDENT: I don't think so.
                DEAN: I don't think he did. I think he knew there
                was a capacity to do this, but he wouldn't,
                wasn't giving it specific direction.
                PRESIDENT: Strachan, did he know?
                DEAN: I think Strachan did know.
                PRESIDENT: They were going back into the DNC? Hunt
                never entered DNC.
                DEAN: All right, so--uh, those people are in
                trouble as a result of the Grand Jury and
                the trial. Mitchell, of course, was never
                called during the trial. Now --
                PRESIDENT: Mitchell has given a sworn statement?
                DEAN: Yes, sir.
                PRESIDENT: To the Bureau?
                DEAN: To the Grand Jury --
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 21
                PRESIDENT: Did he go before the Grand Jury?
                DEAN: He had, we had a, an arrangement whereby he
                went down to, with several of the -- because
                it was, you know, the heat of this thing and
                the implications on the election' we made an
                arrangement where they could quietly go into
                the Department of Justice and have one of
                The Assistant U.S. Attorneys come over and
                take their testimony and then read it before
                the Grand Jury. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: That was (unintelligible).
                DEAN: Although I--that's right. Mitchell \la5
                actually called before the Grand Jury. Tile
                Grand Jury would not settle for less. The
                Jurors wanted him.
                PRESIDENT: And he went.
                DEAN: And he went.
                PRESIDENT: Good.
                DEAN: Uh, I don't know what he said. Uh, so I've
                never seen a transcript of the Grand Jury.
                Now (sighs) what, what has happened postJune 17? Well, it was, I was under pretty
                clear instructions (laughs) not to really
                investigate this, that this was something
                that just could have been disastrous on the
                election if it had--all hell had broken
                loose, and I worked on a theory of
                containment...
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 10:55 A.M. 22
                PRESIDENT: Sure.
                DEAN: ...to try to hold it right where it was.
                PRESIDENT: Right
                DEAN: There's no doubt, I, I, uh, that, uh, I was
                totally aware what the Bureau was doing at
                all times. I was totally aware of what the
                Grand Jury was doing.
                PRESIDENT: You mean--
                DEAN: I knew what witnesses were going to be
                called. I knew what they were going to be
                asked, and I had to. There just--
                PRESIDENT: Why did Petersen play the, play the game so
                straight with us?
                DEAN: Because Petersen is a soldier. He played--
                he kept me informed. He told me when we had
                problems, where we had problems, and the
                like Uh, he believes in, in, in you. He
                believes in this Administration. This
                Administration has made him. Uh, I don't
                thinly he's done anything improper, but he
                did make sure the investigation was narrowed
                dozen to the very, very...
                PRESIDENT: Plight.
                DEAN: ...fine...
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 23
                DEAN: ...criminal things, which was a break for
                us. There's no doubt about it.
                PRESIDENT: He honestly feels that he did an adequate
                job?
                DEAN: He, uh, they ran that investigation out to
                the fullest extent they could follow a lead
                (coughs) and that was it.
                PRESIDENT: But the point is, where I suppose he could
                be criticized for not-doing an adequate job
                is why didn't he call Haldeman? Thy didn't
                he get a statement from Colson? Or they did
                get Colson?
                DEAN: That's right. But see, the thing is, is
                based on their FBI interviews, there was no
                reason to follow up. There were no leads
                there. Colson said, "I have no knowledge of
                this" to the FBI. Uh, Strachan said, "I
                have no knowledge of--" you know. They
                didn't ask Strachan any Watergate questions.
                They asked him about Segretti. Uh, they
                said, "What's your connection with Liddy?"
                and he just said, "Well, I, you know I just,
                met him over there," and they never really
                pressed him. They didn't you know, they--
                look, Strachan appeared, uh, as a result of
                some coaching, he could be the dumbest paper
                pusher in the bowels of the, the White
                House. All right, now, post-June 17th,
                these guys immediately--it is very, very
                (laughs) interesting --Liddy, for example,
                the Friday
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 24
                before--uh, on I guess it was the, uh on the
                15th, uh, 16th, uh, of, uh, June--had been
                in Henry Petersen's office with another
                member of my staff on campaign compliance
                (laughs) problems, uh, joking. After the
                incident, he went, he ran, uh, Kleindienst
                doom at Burning Tree Country Club and told
                (laughs) him that "You've got to get my men
                out of jail," which was kind of a--
                Kleindienst said, "Now, you get the hell out
                of here, kid, uh, uh, whatever you've got to
                say, just say to somebody else. Don't
                bother me," and-- but this has never come
                up.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: Uh, Liddy said, said that, you know -- they
                all got counsel instantly and said that, you
                know' "she'll, we'll ride this thing out."
                All right, then they started waking demands;
                We've got to have attorneys' fees. Uh, we
                don’t have any money ourselves, and if-you
                are asking us to take this through the
                election." All right, so arrangements were
                made through Mitchell, uh, initiating it, in
                discussions that--I was present-that these
                guys had to be taken care of. Their
                attorneys' fees had to be done. Kalmbach
                alas brought in. Uh, Kalmbach raised some
                cash. Uh, they were, uh, you know--
                PRESIDENT: They put that under the cover of a Cuban
                Committee or (unintelligible).
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 25
                DEAN: Yeah, they, they had a Cuban Committee and
                they had--some of it was given to Hunt's
                lawyer, who in turn passed it out. This,
                you know, when Hunt’s wife was flying to
                Chicago with ten thousand, she was actually,
                I understand after the fact now, was going
                to pass that money to, uh, one of the
                Cubans, to meet him in Chicago and pass it
                to somebody there.
                PRESIDENT: Why didn't she (unintelligible) maybe--well,
                whether it's maybe too late to-do anything
                about it, but I would certainly keep that,
                (laughs) that cover for whatever it's worth.
                DEAN: I'll...
                PRESIDENT: Keep the Committee.
                DEAN Af-, after, well, that, that; that's the
                most troublesome post-thing, uh, because (1)
                Bob is involved in that; John is involved in
                that; I'm involved in that; Mitchell is
                involved in that. And that's an obstruction
                of justice.
                PRESIDENT: In other words the fact that uh, that you're
                you're, you're taking care Of the witnesses.
                DEAN: That's right, uh--
                PRESIDENT: How was Bob involved?
                DEAN: Well, th-, they ran out of money over there.
                Bob had three hundred and fifty thousand
                dollars in a safe over here that was really
                set aside for polling purposes. ills and
                there was no other source of money, so they
                came over here and said, "You all've got to
                give us some money."
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 26
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: I had to go to Bob and say, "Bob, you know,
                you've got to have some--they need some
                money over there." He said "What for?" And
                so I had to tell him what it was for 'cause
                he wasn't about to just send money over
                there willy-nilly. And, uh, Jolly was
                involved in those discussions, and we
                decided, you know, that, you know, that
                there was no price too high to pay to let
                this thing blow up in front of the election.
                PRESIDENT: I think you - should handle that one pretty
                fast.
                DEAN: Oh, I think--
                PRESIDENT: That issue, I mean.
                DEAN: I think we can.
                PRESIDENT: So that the three-fifty went back ov-, over
                here
                DEAN: That's alright. I think we can too.
                PRESIDENT: Who else is?
                DEAN: But, now, here, here's what's happening
                right now.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 27
                DEAN: What sort of brings matters to the--this is
                (1) this-is going to be continual blackmail operation by Hunt and Liddy and the
                Cubans. No doubt about it. And McCord...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah .
                DEAN: who is, who is another one involved. McCord
                has asked for nothing. Uh, McCord did ask
                to meet with somebody, and it was Jack
                Caulfield, who is his old friend, who'd
                gotten him hired over the-ret And, when,
                when, when Caulfield had him hired, he was a
                perfectly legitimate security man. And he
                wanted to know, well, you know, (coughs) he
                wanted to talk about commutation, and things
                like that. And as you know Colson has
                talked to, indirectly to Hunt about
                commutation. (Clears throat). All these
                things are bad, in, in, in that they are
                problems, they are promises, they are
                commitments. They are the very sort of
                thing that the Senate is going to be looking
                most for. I don't think they can find them,
                frankly.
                PRESIDENT: Pretty hard.
                DEAN: Pretty hard. Damn hard. It's all cash.
                Uh--
                PRESIDENT: Lowell, I mean, pretty hard as far as the
                witnesses are concerned.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 28
                DEAN: That's right. Now, The blackmail is
                continuing. Hunt called one of the lawyers
                from the Re-election Committee on last
                Friday to meet with him on--over the
                weekend. The guy came in to me, to see me
                to get a message directly from Hunt to me,
                for the first time.
                PRESIDENT: Is Hunt out on bail?
                DEAN: Pardon?
                PRESIDENT: Is Hunt on bail?
                DEAN: Hunt is on bail. Correct. Uh, Hunt now is
                demanding another seventy-to thousand
                dollars for his own personal expenses;
                another fifty thousand dollars to pay his
                attorneys' fees; a hundred and twenty some
                thousand dollars. Wants it, wanted it by
                the close of business yesterday. 'Cause he
                says, "I'm going to be sentenced on Friday,
                and I've got to be able to get my financial
                affairs in order." I told this fellow
                O'Brien, "You came--all right, you came to
                the wrong man, fellow. I'm not involved in
                the money. Uh, I don't know a thing about
                it, can't help you." Said, "You better
                scramble around elsewhere." Now, O'Brien is,
                O'Brien. is, is a ball player. He's been,
                he carried tremendous water for us. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: He isn't Hunt's lawyer, is he?
                DEAN: No, he is, he is our-lawyer at the Reelection Committee.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 29
                PRESIDENT: I see, good.
                DEAN: So he's safe. There's no problem there.
                But it raises the whole question of Hunt now
                has made a direct threat against Ehrlichman,
                as a result of this. This is his blackmail.
                He says, "I will bring John Ehrlichman down
                to his knees and put him in jail. Uh, I
                have done enough seamy things for he and
                Krogh, uh, that they'll never survive it."
                PRESIDENT: What's that, on Ellsberg? -
                DEAN: Ellsberg, and apparently some other things.
                I don't know the full extent of it. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: I don't know about anything else.
                DEAN: I don't know either, and I (laughs) hate to
                learn some of these things. So that's, that
                's that situation. Now, we're at the soft
                points. How many people know about this?
                Hell, uh, well, let me go one step further
                in this, this whole thing. The Cubans that
                were used in the Watergate were also the
                same Cubans that Hunt and Liddy used for
                this California Ellsberg thing, for the
                break-in out there.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: So they're, they're aware of that. How high
                their knowledge is, is something else. Hunt
                and Liddy, of course, are totally aware of,
                of, of it, and the fact that, uh, it was
                rift out of the White House.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 30
                PRESIDENT: I don't know what the hell we did that for.
                DEAN: I don't either.
                PRESIDENT: What in the name of God did that--
                DEAN: Mr. President, there have been a couple of
                things around here that I have gotten wind
                of. Uh, there was at one time a desire to
                do a second-story job on the Brookings
                Institute where they had the Pentagon
                Papers. Now I flew to California because I
                was told that John had instructed it and he
                said, "I really hadn't. It's- a
                misimpression, that for Christ's sake, turn
                it off." And I did. I came back and turned
                it off. Because, you know the, when you,
                you know, if the risk is minimal and the,
                and the gain is fantastic, it's something
                else. But with a low risk and uh, no gain,
                uh, hey, it's just, uh, it's not worth it.
                Well--who knows about this all now? All
                right, you've got (clears throat) the
                Cubans' lawyer's' a man by the name of
                Rothblatt, who is a no-good, publicityseeking, son-of-a-bitch, to be very frank
                about it. He has had to be turned down and
                tuned off. He was canned by his own people
                cause they didn't trust him. They were
                trying to run a different route than he
                wanted to run. He didn't want them to plead
                guilty. He wants to represent them before
                the Senate. So, F. Lee Bailey, who was the
                partner of one of the, one of the men
                representing McCord; uh, got in and, and
                cooled Rothblatt down. So, F. Lee B-,
                Bailey's got knowledge. Uh, Hunt's lawyer,
                a man by the name of Bittman, who's an
                excellent criminal lawyer from the
                Democratic era of Bobby Kennedy, he's got
                knowledge. Uh--
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 31
                PRESIDENT: Do you think, do you think, that he's got
                some How much?
                DEAN: Well, everybody-not only, all the, all the
                direct knowledge that Hunt and Liddy have,
                as well as all the hearsay they have.
                PRESIDENT: I (unintelligible).
                DEAR: Uh, you've got the trio lawyers over at the
                Re-election Committee who did an
                investigation to find out the facts.
                Slowly, they got the whole picture.
                They're, uh, they're solid, but they're--
                PRESIDENT: But they know.
                DEAN: But they know. Uh, you've got, then, an
                awful lot of--all the principals involved
                know. Uh, Hunt--some people's wives know.
                PRESIDENT: Sure.
                DEAN: Uh, there's no doubt about that. Mrs. Hunt
                was the savviest woman in the world. She
                had the whole picture together.
                PRESIDENT: Did she?
                DEAN: Yeah, it, uh--apparently, she was the pillar
                of strength in that family before the death,
                and, uh--
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 32
                PRESIDENT: Great sadness. The basis, as Smatter of
                fact (clears throat) there was some
                discussion (unintelligible) uh, Hunt's
                problems after his wife died and I said, of
                course, commutation could be considered on
                the basis of his wife, and that is the only
                discussion I ever had in that light.
                DEAN: Right. Uh, so that's, that's it. That's
                the, the extent of the knowledge. Now,
                where, where are the soft spots on this?
                Well, first of all, there's the, there's the
                problem of the continued blackmail
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: ...which will not only go on now, it'll goon
                when these people are in prison, and it will
                compound the obstruction of justice
                situation. It'll cost money. It's
                dangerous. Nobody, nothing--people around
                here are not pros at this sort of thing.
                This is the sort of thing Mafia people can
                do: washing money, getting clean money, and
                things like that, uh--we're--we just don't
                know about those (noise) things, because
                we're-not used to, you know--we are not
                criminals and not used to dealing in that
                business. It's, uh, it's, uh--
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: It's tough thing to know how to do.
                PRESIDENT: Maybe we can't even do that.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 33
                DEAN: That's right. It's a real problem as to
                whether we could even do it. Plus there's a
                real problem in raising money. Uh, Mitchell
                has been working on raising some money. Uh,
                feeling he's got, you know, he's got one,
                he's one of the ones with the most to lose.
                Uh, but there's no denying the fact that the
                White House, and uh, Ehrlichman, Haldeman,
                Dean are involved in some of the early money
                decisions.
                PRESIDENT: How much money do you need?
                DEAN: I would say these people are going to cost,
                uh, a million dollars over the next, uh, -
                two years. (Pause)
                PRESIDENT: We could get that.
                DEAN: Uh, huh.
                PRESIDENT: You, on the money, if you need the money, I
                mean, uh' you could get the money. Let's
                say--
                DEAN: Well, I think that we're going--
                PRESIDENT: What I mean is, you could, you could get a
                million dollars. And you could get it in
                cash. I, I know where it could be gotten.
                DEAN: Uh, huh.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 34
                PRESIDENT: I mean it's not easy, but it could be acne.
                But, uh, the question is who the hell would
                handle it?
                DEAN: That's right, uh--
                PRESIDENT: Any ideas on that?
                DEAN: Well, I would think that would be something
                that Mitchell ought to be charged with.
                PRESIDENT: I would think so, too.
                DEAN: And get some, get some pros to help him.
                PRESIDENT: Let me say, there shouldn't be a lot of
                people running around getting money. We
                should set up a little--
                DEAN: Well, he's got one person doing it who I'm
                not sure is--
                PRESIDENT: Who is that?
                DEAN: He's got Fred LaRue, uh, doing it. Now Fred
                started out going cut trying to...
                PRESIDENT: No.
                DEAN: ...solicit money from all kinds of people.
                Now, I learned about that, and I said, "My
                God"...
                PRESIDENT: No.
                DEAN: ..."It's just awful. Don't do it."
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 35
                DEAN: Uh, people are going to ask what the money
                is for. He's working-- apparently he talked
                to Tom Pappas.
                PRESIDENT: I know.
                (Noise)
                DEAN: And Pappas has, uh, agreed to come up wit1 a
                sizeable amount, I gather, from,
                from...(Noise)
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...Mitchell.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah, well, what do you need, then? You
                need, uh, you don't need a million right
                away, but you need a million. Is that
                right?
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: You need a million in cash, don't you? If
                you want to put that through, would you put
                that through, uh--this is thinking out loud
                here for a moment--would you put that
                through the Cuban Committee?
                DEAN: Umm, no,
                PRESIDENT: Or would you just do this through a
                (unintelligible) that it's going to be, uh,
                well, it's cash money, and so forth. How,
                if that ever comes out, are you going to
                handle it? Is the Cuban Committee an
                obstruction of justice, if they want to
                help?
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 36
                DEAN: Well, they've got a pr-, they've got
                priests, and they--
                PRESIDENT: Would you like to put, I mean, would that,
                would that give a little bit of a cover, for
                example?
                DEAN: That would give some for the Cubans and
                possibly Hunt.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: Uh, then you've got Liddy and--McCord is
                not, not accepting any money. So he's, he
                is not a bought man right now. (Pause)
                PRESIDENT: Okay.
                DEAN: All right. Let, let me, uh
                PRESIDENT: Go ahead.
                DEAN: ...continue a little bit here now. The, uh,
                I, when I say this is a a growing cancer,
                uh, I say it for reasons like this. Bud
                Krogh in his testimony before the Grand
                Jury, was forced to perjure himself. Uh, he
                is haunted by it. Uh, Bud said, "I haven't
                had a pleasant day on the job."
                PRESIDENT: Huh, said what?
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 37
                DEAN: He said, "I have not had a pleasant day on
                my job." Uh, he's talked, apparently, he
                said to me, "I told my wife all about this,"
                he said. "The, uh, the curtain may ring
                down one of these days, and' uh, I may have
                to face the music, which I'm perfectly
                willing to do." Uh--
                PRESIDENT: What did he perjure himself on, John?
                DEAN: His, did, uh, did he know the Cubans? He
                did. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: He said he didn't?
                DEAN: That's right. They didn't press him hard,
                or that he--
                PRESIDENT: He might be able to--I'm just trying to
                think. Perjury is an awful hard rap to
                prove. He could say that I (pause) hem,
                well, go-ahead.
                DEAN: (Coughs) Well, so that's, that's the first,
                that's one perjury. Now, Mitchell and, and,
                uh, Magruder are potential perjuries. There
                is always the possibility of any one of
                these individuals blowing. Hunt, Liddy.
                Liddy's in jail right now; he's serving his-
                -trying to get good time right now. I think
                Liddy is probably, in his, in his own
                bizarre way, the strongest of all of them.
                Uh, so there's, there is that possibility.
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 38
                PRESIDENT: Well, your, your major, your major guy keep
                under control is Hunt.
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: I think. Because he knows...
                DEAN: He knows so much.
                PRESIDENT: ...about a lot of other things.
                DEAN: He knows so much. Right. Uh, he could sink
                Chuck Colson. Apparently, apparently, he is
                quite distressed with Colson. He thinks
                Colson has abandoned him. Uh, Colson was to
                meet with him when he was out there, after,
                now he had left the White House. He met
                with him through his lawyer. Hunt raised
                the question he wanted money. Colson's
                lawyer told him that Colson wasn't doing
                anything smith money, and Hunt took offense
                with that immediately, that, uh, uh, that
                Colson had abandoned him. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: Don't you, just looking at the immediate
                problem, don't you have to have--handle
                Hunt's financial situation
                DEAN: I, I think that's--
                PRESIDENT: ...damn soon?
                DEAN: That is, uh, I talked to Mitchell about that
                last night--
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 39
                PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)
                DEAN: And, and, uh, I told--
                PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible) may--after all, You've got
                to keep the cap on the bottle that much...
                DEAN: That's right; that's right.
                PRESIDENT: ...in order to have any options.
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: Either that or let it all blow right now.
                DEAN: Well, that, you know' that's the, that's the
                question. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: Now, go ahead. The others. You've got
                Hunt... -
                DEAN: All right, now we've got--
                PRESIDENT: ...you've got Krogh, and you've got--
                DEAN: Now we've got Kalmbach (coughs).
                PRESIDENT: Yeah, that's a tough one.
                DEAN: Kalmbach received...
                PRESIDENT: (unintelligible)
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 40
                DEAN: ...at the close of the, of the, uh, '68
                campaign, in January of '69, he got a
                million seven dollars, uh, a million seven
                hundred thousand dollars to be custodian
                for. That cane down from New York. It was
                placed in safe deposit boxes here. Uh, some
                other people were on the boxes, and
                ultimately, the money was taken out to
                California. All right, there is knowledge
                of the fact that he did start with a million
                seven. Several people know this. Now,
                since '69, he's spent a good deal of this
                money and, and, uh, accounting for it is
                going to be very difficult for Herb. For
                example, he's spent--oh-close to five
                hundred thousand dollars on private polling.
                Now that just opens up a whole new thing.
                It's not illegal, but, uh, it's more of the
                same sort of thing.
                PRESIDENT: I don't think that poses a hell of a
                problem, does it?
                DEAN: No, I don't think so. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: Practically everybody does polling.
                DEAN: That's right, uh, it's not, there's nothing
                criminal about it. It was private polls.:
                It was...
                PRES IDEAL: Nothing--
                DEAN: ...uh, proper money.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 41
                PRESIDENT: The law didn't, the law didn't
                (unintelligible)...
                DEAN: (Coughs )
                PRESIDENT: ... polled all through the years.
                DEAN: That’s right-. Uh, he sent four hundred
                thousand dollars, as he's described to me,
                somewhere in the South or another candidate.
                I assume this was four hundred, uh, that
                went...
                PRESIDENT: Wallace.
                DEAN: ...to Wallace. Right. Uh; he has
                maintained, uh, a, a man, who I only I know
                by the name of "Tony", who is the fellow]
                who did the, the Chappaquidick study and...
                PRESIDENT: I heard about that.
                DEAN: ...other, other odd jobs like that. Nothing illegal...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...uh, but closer. Uh, I don't know of
                anything that Herb has done that is illegal,
                other than the fact that he doesn't want to
                blow the whistle on a lot of people, and may
                find himself in a perjury situation.
                PRESIDENT: Well, if he, uh, he could--because he will
                be asked about that money.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 42
                DEAN: He will. What'll happen is, when they call
                him up there--and he of course has no
                immunity, uh, they'll say, "How did you
                happen--how did you pay Mr. Segretti?"
                "Well, I had cash on hand" "Well, how much
                cash did you have on hand?"
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: Uh, where does he go from there? "Where did
                you get the cash?"
                PRESIDENT: Uh, huh.
                DEAN: A full series of questions. His bank
                records indicate he had cash on hand,
                because some of these were set up in trustee
                accounts.
                PRESIDENT: How would you handle him, then, John? For
                example, would you just have him put the
                whole thing out?
                DEAN: (Draws breath)
                PRESIDENT: I don't think so. I mean I don't mind the
                five hundred thousand dollars and I don't
                mind the four hundred thousand dollars...
                DEAN: No, that--
                PRESIDENT: ...for activities (unintelligible).
                DEAN: That, that, uh, that doesn't bother me
                either. There's--as I say, Herb's problems
                are...
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 43
                PRESIDENT: There's a surplus--
                DEAN: ...politically embarrassing, but not as, not
                criminal.
                PRESIDENT: Well, they're embarrassing, sure--he, he
                just handled matters that were between the
                campaigns, before anything was done. There
                were surveys, et cetera, et cetera, et
                cetera, et cetera, There is no need to
                account for that. No law requires him to
                account for that.
                DEAN: Right. Uh, now--
                PRESIDENT: The source of the money, there's no
                illegality in having a surplus, is there, in
                cash afterwards?
                DEAN: No, the money-it has always been argued by
                Stans--came from pre-convention.
                PRESIDENT: Pre-convention.
                DEAN: For the--and pre-primary for the, for the,
                uh...
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: ...'68 race.
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: It was just set aside.
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: Uh, that, that all can be explained. I
                think that the--
                MARCH 21, l973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 44
                PRESIDENT: All right. How do your other
                vulnerabilities go together?
                DEAN: The other vulnerabilities: We've got a, uh,
                runaway Grand Jury up in the Southern
                District.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah, I heard.
                DEAN: They're after Mitchell and Stans on some
                sort of bribe or influence peddling...
                PRESIDENT: On Vesco.
                DEAN: ...with Vesco.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: Uh, they're also going to try to drag
                Ehrlichman into that. Apparent' y,
                Ehrlichman had some meetings with Vesco,
                also. Uh, Don Nixon, Jr., came in to see
                John a couple of times, uh, about the
                problem.
                PRESIDENT: Not about the Complaint.
                DEAN: That, there's uh--the fact of the matter is-
                -
                PRESIDENT: He came about a job.
                DEAN: That's right. And, and, and, uh, I-
                MARCH 21, 1973, FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 45
                PRESIDENT: We're, it's--Ehrlichman's totally to blame
                on that.
                DEAN: Yeah. Well, I think...
                PRESIDENT: No White House (unintelligible).
                DEAN: No one has done anything for...
                PRESIDENT: ...Vesco.
                DEAN: ...Vesco.
                PRESIDENT: ...matter of--not for the prosecutor.
                DEAN: No. (Coughs) The, uh--
                PRESIDENT: Would Ehrlichman, incidentally, have to
                appear there?
                DEAN: Before that Grand Jury? Yes. He could very
                well.
                PRESIDENT: Uh, we couldn't presume immunity there?
                DEAN: Not really. Uh, criminal charge--
                PRESIDENT: Criminal charge--yeah. (Unintelligible) the
                charge is, mind you. Go ahead.
                DEAN: Right. That's a little different. (Clears
                throat) I think that would be dynamite to
                defend, uh...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...against that.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 46
                PRESIDENT: Also, he, he distinguishes it. He says,
                "It's criminal charge; I'll be glad to go
                up." Use the Flanigan... -
                DEAN: Right.
                PRESIDENT: ...analogy.
                DEAN: Right, uh, (clears throat) well, that's,
                that's pretty much the overall picture and
                probably the most troublesome thing--well,
                the Segretti thing. Let's get down to that.
                I think Bob has indicated to me he told you
                a lot of, of it, that he, indeed, did
                authorize it. He didn't authorize anything
                like ultimately evolved.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: He was aware of it. He was aware that
                Chapin and Strachan were looking for
                somebody.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: Again, this is one that, uh, it is potential
                that Dwight Cha-, Chapin could have a felony
                charge against him in this, because he's--
                PRESIDENT: Felony?
                DEAN: Felony. Because he has to, he has to
                disprove a negative. The negative is that
                he didn't control and direct Segretti.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 47
                PRESIDENT: Would the felony be in perjury again? Or--
                DEAN: Uh, no. The felony this, in this instance
                being a potential use of the, one of the
                civil rights statutes, for anybody who
                interferes with a candidate for, uh,
                national office--not in, interferes with
                their campaign in any way.
                PRESIDENT: shy isn't (unintelligible) civil rights
                statute be used to pick up any of these
                clowns that were demonstrating against us,
                then?
                DEAN: Well, I have, I've, I've argued that they
                use that for that very purpose. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: Really?
                DEAN: Yes, I have. And, uh--
                PRESIDENT: We were, those were, uh, that was
                interfering with the campaign. -
                DEAN: That's exactly right. That's exactly right.
                But they--
                PRESIDENT: The Segretti one, I think, uh, I'm not as
                con-cerned about that because it's so bad
                the way it's been put out on the PR side,
                then I think it will eventually end up on
                the PR side very confused. And it'll fool;
                bad when that's attributed, but I don't, I
                can't see the criminal thing, (clears
                throat) but I just may be wrong.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 48
                DEAN: Well, here, what really, what really bothers
                me is that this, this growing situation--as
                I say it is growing because of the, the
                continued need to-provide support for the...
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: ...Watergate people who are going to
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...hold us up for everything they've got
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: ...and the need for some people to perjure
                themselves as they go down the road here.
                Uh, if this thing ever blows, and we're in a
                cover-up situation, I think it'd be
                extremely damaging to you, uh, and uh, the,
                uh--
                PRESIDENT: Sure.
                DEAN: Uh--
                PRESIDENT: The whole concept of Administration justice.
                DEAN: That's right, uh--
                PRESIDENT: We cannot have--
                DEAN: That's what really troubles me. For
                example, what happens if it starts breaking,
                and they do find a criminal case against a
                Haldeman, a Dean, a Mitchell, an Ehrlichman?
                Uh, that is--
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 49
                PRESIDENT: Well, if it really comes down to that, we
                cannot, maybe--we'd have to shed it in order
                to contain it again.
                DEALN: (Clears throat) That's right. I'm coming
                down to the--what I really think is that,
                that, Bob and John and John Mitchell and I
                should sit down and spend a day, or however
                long, to figure out (1) how this can be
                carved away from you, so it does not damage
                you or the Presidency. 'Cause it just
                can't. And it's not something, it, you're
                not involved in it and it's something you
                shouldn't--
                PRESIDENT: That is true.
                DEAN: I know, sir, it is. Well, I can just tell
                from our conversations that, you know, them
                are things that you have no knowledge of.
                PRESIDENT: The absurdity of the whole damned thing...
                DEAN: But it--
                PRESIDENT: bugging and so on. Well, let me say I am
                keenly aware of the fact that, uh, Colson,
                et al, and so forth were doing their best to
                get information and so forth and so on. But
                they all knew very well they were supposed
                to comply with the law.
                DEAN: That's right.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 50
                PRESIDENT: No question.
                DEAN: Uh--
                PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible) you think--you feel that
                really the man, the triggerman was Colson on
                this end?
                DEAN: Well, no. He was one of se-, he was just in
                the chain. He was, he helped push the
                thing.
                PRESIDENT: Called him up and said, "we've got a, we've
                got (unintelligible)" I don't know what the
                Christ he would be doing. Oh, I'll bet you,
                I know why. That was at the time of ITT.
                He was trying to get something going there
                because ITT--they were bugging us, I mean
                they were
                DEAN: Right.
                PRESIDENT: ...giving us hell.
                DEAN: Well, I know, I know he used, uh--
                PRESIDENT: Hunt to go out there?
                DEAN: Hunt.
                PRESIDENT: I knew about that.
                DEAN: Yeah.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 51
                PRESIDENT: I did know about it at the time. I knew
                that there was, there was something going on
                there...
                DEAN: Right.
                PRESIDENT: ...but I didn't know it was Hunt.
                DEAN: Right. Uh, that's what re, what really
                troubles me is, you know, (1) will this
                thing not break some day and...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...the whole thing--domino situation.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah
                DEAN: You know, they just, I think if it starts
                crumbling, fingers will be pointing, and--
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: Uh--
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: Bob will be accused of things he has never
                heard of...
                PRES IDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: ...and then he'll have to disprove it, and
                it'll just get nasty and it'll be a real,
                uh, real bad situation. And the person who
                will be hurt by it most will be you and...
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 52
                PRESIDENT: Of course.
                DEAN: ...the Presidency, and I just don't think--
                PRESIDENT: First, because I'm expected to know this,
                and I'm supposed to, supposed to check these
                things. And so forth...
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: and so on. But let's, let's, let's come
                back and go further. Sure. Yes, indeed.
                But what are your feelings, yourself, John?
                You know pretty well what they'll all say.
                What are your feelings toward the options?
                DEAN: I am not confident that, uh, we can ride
                through this. I think there are, I think
                there are soft spots.
                PRESIDENT: You used to feel comfortable.
                DEAN: Well, I feel, I felt, I felt comfortable for
                this reason. I've noticed of recent since
                the publicity has increased on, on this
                thing again, with the Gray hearings, that
                everybody is now starting to watch out for
                their own behind. Uh--
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: Everyone's pulling in. They're getting
                their own counsel. More counsel are
                getting..
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 53
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: ...involved.
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: Uh, you know, "How do I protect my ass?"
                PRESIDENT: Well, they're scared.
                DEAN: They're scared and that's just, you know,
                that's bad. We were able to hold it for a
                long time.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah, I know.
                DEAN: Uh, another thing is, you know, my facility
                now to deal with the multitude of people I
                have been dealing with has been hampered
                because of Gray blowing me up into the front

                So on. So, so, what you really come dozen
                to is, what in the hell, in the hell will
                you do? Let's, let us suppose that you and
                Haldeman and Ehrlichman and Mitchell say,
                uh, "We can't hold this". What, what then
                are you going to say? Are you going to put
                out a complete disclosure? Isn't that the
                best plan?

                DEAN: Well, one way to do it is to--
                PRESIDENT: That'd by my view on it.
                DEAN: One way to do it is for you to in-, tell the
                Attorney General that you can finally, you

            <p>(S/NF) The President: Congratulations on a great victory. We all
                watched from the United States and you did a terrific.job. The
                way.you came from behind, -somebody who wasn't given much of a
                chan�e, and you ended up winning ea�ily. It'� a fantastic
                achievement. Congratulations.
                (:J;'UP' President Zelenskyy: You· are absolutely right Mr.
                Presideht.• We did win big and we worked hard for _this. We worked
                a lot but I would like to confe$s to you that I had �n
                opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your
                skills· and knowledge and were able to use .it as an example to·r
                our ele.ctions -and.yes it is-true that these were unique
                elections. We were in a·unique situation· that we· were able to achieve a unique success. I'm able to tell you the following;
                the first time,\ you· called me to · congratulate .
                me .when I won my
                <div>
                    <center><img class="center_2" src="mynd(2).gif" alt=".gif"></center>
                </div>
                presid�ntial election, and the second time you are now calling
                me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I
                should run more often so you can call me more often and we can
                talk over the phone more often.
                (�;'!��) The Pre�:ddent: [laughter] That's a very good idea. T ·
                think your c·ount,ry is very happy about that.
                (S/iQl',. President Zelenskyy: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we
                are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp
                here in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the
                old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to
                have a new format and a new type of government .. You are a great
                teacher for us and in that.
                (3/H!i, The President: Well it 1 s·very nice of you .to say that. I
                will say that we do ·a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot . of effort
                and a lot.of time. Much more than the European countries are
                ·'doing and they should be helping.you more than.they are. Germany
                does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think
                it's something that you should ·really ask them about. When I.was·
                ·speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she ·doesn't do·
                anything. A lot of the European countries are the. same way· so I
                think it's.something you want to look at but the United States
                has been very ·very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's
                reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not
                good but the United States has been very very
                .
                good to Ukraine.
                (3/MF) President Zelenskyy: Yes you are·absolutely right. �ot
                .only 100%, but actually 1000% arid I can tell you the following;
                I did talk to Angela �erkel and I did meet.with her. I also met
                and talked withMacron . and I told them that they are not doing
                quite as much as they need to be doing·on the issues with the
                sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not
                working as much as
                .
                they should work for Ukraine� It turns out
                that even though logically, the European Union should be our
                biggest· partner but technically the United States is a much
                bigger partner than.the European Union and- I'm very grateful to
                you for that because the United States is doing quite a· lot for
                Ukraine. Much more than the E"�ropean Union especially when we
                are talking about sanctions against the Russia,n Federation. r·
                · would also·li�e to thank you·for.your great support iri the area
                of defense. . We. are ready to continue to cooperate for the next
                steps. specifically we a·re almost. ready to buy more Javelins from
                ·_ the United· States for defense purposes ..
                •t:�;'HP) The· President: I would like you to do us a favor though
                because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a
                lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with
                this whole si�uation with Ukraine, they s_ay Crowdstrike ... I guess
                you have one of your weal thy people... The server, they say
                Ukraine has.it� There- are a lot. of things that went on, the·
                :whole situation .. I think you 1 re _surrounding yourse·lf with some
                of the same people. I .
                would like to have the Attorney General
                call you or your people and I would like you t� ·get to the
                bottom of it�. As you sa� yest�rday, that whole nonsetise ended
                with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mue�le_r, an
                incompetent performance-, _but they. say a lot of it started with
                Ukraine. Whatever you can do, ·it's very important that· you. do it
                if that's possible.
                (l!l-,'HP) President Zelenskyy: Yes it is. very important for me and
everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a
President,-· it is very important and we are open for any future
cooperation. We are ready to· open a new page on �ooperation in
. relations between the United· States and Ukraine.· For that·
purpose, I just recalled our.ambassador from United States and
he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced
ambassador who wtll work hard on making sure that our two
nations are getting clciser. I would also like and hope to see
him having your trust and y9ur .confidence and _ have persona·1
relations·with you so we c�n cooperate even �ore so. I·
wili.
personally tell you that one· of my assistants· spoke with Mr.
Giuliani just.recently and we are hoping very much that Mr.
G1uliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and. we will meet once
· he co�es to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again_that
you _have nobody but friends around-us. I w.ill make sure -that-I
surro�nd myself with the best and most experienced people._ I
also· wanted to ·tell you that we are friends. We are great·
friends and you Mr. President have. friends -in our country so we
can continue our strategic·�artn�rship. I also plan to surround
· myself with great people ·and in addition to that investigation,
I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that all the
investigations.will be done_openly and candidly .. That I can
assure you ..
(:9/MF� The Pre·sident: Good because I· heard you had a prosecutor
who· was very·good and he was shut down and that's really unfair.
_·A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your
�ery good prosecutor down and you had some �ery bad people
involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the_
mayor bf New York Ci:ty, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call yoti along with the Attorney·_
·· General.· :Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very
capable guy. If you could _speak to him that would be great. The
former ambassador from the United $tates,· the woman., was bad
news �nd th� people she was dealing with in .the Ukraine .were bad
news so I jtist wan� to_let you know that� The ot�er thing,
There's a lot 6f. talk about Biden's son,. that Eiden stopped the
prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so
whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.
Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if
you ·can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.
(S;'ti!F) President Zelenskyy: I wanted to tell ·you about the
prosecutor� First df �11 I understand arid I'm kn6wledgeable
.abotit the situation. Sine� we ha�e �on· the ab�olute majority in
our Parliament; the next prosecutor .general will be 100%_ my
person, my c'andidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and
will start. a_s a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look.
into the situation, specifically to the company that you
-mentioned in :this issue. The issue of the investigation of the
case is �ctually the issui of �aking sure to res�o�e the honesty
so we will take care of.that and wi11·wo:tk on the investigation
of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have
any additional information that you can provide ·to µs, it would_
be very helpful · for the investigation t·o make· su.re that we
administer justice i':r1 our country with regc:ird: to the Ambassador
to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name
was Ivanovicli. It was great that you were the first one. who told
me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree·with you 100%.
Her attitude to.wards me was far from the best as she admired the
previous President and she was on his· side. She would not accept
�e as a new President· well enough.
. . . .
(3/MF) The President: Well,
·she' s going tO go through some
things. I will. have Mr. Giuliani.give you a call and I _ am. also
going to have.Attorney General Barr call and we will get to· the
bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it o�t. I heard the
prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fa�r
prosecuto_r so good luck with everything. Your. economy is going-·
to get better and bett.er I pre.diet. You have a lot· of a,ssets.
It's a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their
incredible ·people.
(B/MF�- President Z�lenskyy: I would like to tell you that I also
have.quite a few·Ukrain1an friends that live iri the United·
States. ·Actually last time I traveled to the Unit'ed States, I
stayed in New York n�ar Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower. I will t
·alk to thetn and I hope to see t_hem· again in the
future. I also w·anted to _
.thank you .for your invitation to visit
the United States, specifically Washington DC. On ,the other
hand, I also wartt td ensur� ·you that we will. be ��ry serious
about.the case and will work on the investigation. As to.the
economy, there is much potential for our two countries and one _
of· the ·issues. that is ve:;ry important for Ukraine is· energy
independence. I believe we can b� very succ�ssful. and
cooperating on energy independence witp United States. We -are
already working on cooperation. We are buying Americ�n oil but I
am very hopeful for- ·a future meeting. We will have more time and
more opportunitie� to discuss these opportunities· and get to
know each other better. I would like to thank you very much for
your sv.pport -
(8/Ui?� · The President: Good. Well., thank you very much and I
appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to.·
call. Thank you. Whenever you would like -to come to the White
House,. feel ·fr�e to call. ·Give us a date and we'll work that.
out. I ·1ook forward to seeing you.
(:9/Nil?) · President ·zelens�yy: Thank ·you very much. I would be very
happy to come and would be happy to meet with you per�onally and
I . .
. get to know. you better. ::r: am l.ooking forward to our meeting arid
I .also would like
·
-to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the
city bf Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful
country Which would welcome you. On the other hand, I believe
that on Septernber_l we will be in Poland and we can meet in
Poland hopefully. After that,· it might be a very good idea for
you to.travel to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and go to
Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably mucl� better
than mine.
(�/MF) 'The President: Okay,. ·we can work that ·out. I look forwar·a
to seeing you in Washington and maybe in· Poland bec·ause I think
we are going to be there at that tlme .
. {�/MF) · President · Zelenskyy: Thank you very much Mr. President.
(El/HF� The President:· Congratulations on· a fantastic job you've
done-. The whole world was watching. I'm not sure it was so much
of an upset but congratulations.

                clemency problem for the others. They all
                would expect to be out and that may put you
                in a position that's Just...
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: untenable at some point. You know, the
                Watergate Hearings just over, Hunt now
                demanding clemency or he is going to blow.
                And politically it'd be impossible for, you
                know, you to do it. You know, after
                everybody...
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: I am not sure that you will ever be able to
                deliver on the clemency. It may be just too
                hot.
                PRESIDENT: You can't do it till after the '74
                elections, that's for sure. But even
                then...
                DEAN: (Clears throat)
                PRESIDENT: your point is that even then you couldn't do
                it.
                DEAN: That's right. It may further involve you in
                a way you shouldn't be involved in this.
                PRESIDENT: No it's wrong, that's for sure.
                DEAN: Well, whatever, you know, I, there've been
                some bad Judgments made. There've been some
                necessary Judgments made. Uh...
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 59
                PRESIDENT: Before the election.
                DEAN: Before the election and, in a way, the
                necessary ones, you know, before the
                election. There, you know we've, this was
                to me there was no way
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: that uh...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: But to burden this second Administration
                PRESIDENT: We're all in on it.
                DEAN: was something that, it's something that is
                not going to go away.
                PRESIDENT: No it isn't.
                DEAN: It is not going to go away, sir.
                PRESIDENT: Not going to go away, it is, the idea that,
                uh, that, uh, well, that uh, that people are
                going to get tired of it and all that sort
                of thing...
                DEAN: Anything will spark it back into life. It's
                got to be, uh, it's got to be...
                PRESIDENT: Well, it's too much to the partisan interest
                of others to spark it back into life.
                DEAN: And it seems to me the only way that...
                PRESIDENT: Who else, though? Let's, let's leave you
                and I don't, I don't think on the, on, uh,
                on the obstruction of Justice thing, I think
                that one we can handle. I, I don't know why
                I feel that way, but I...
                DEAN: Well, it is possible that I...
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 60
                PRESIDENT: I, I think you may be overplaying, but who
                else, uh, who else, who else do you think,
                has, uh
                DEAN: Potential criminal liability?
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: I think Ehrlichman does. I think that, uh,
                I think...
                PRESIDENT: Why Ehrlichman? What 'd he do?
                DEAN: Because this conspiracy to burglarize the,
                uh, uh, Ellsberg office.
                PRESIDENT: You mean, that, that is provided Hunt
                breaks.
                DEAN: Well, uh, the, the funny, let me say
                something interesting about that. Within
                the files...
                PRESIDENT: Oh, I saw that. The picture.
                DEAN: Yeah, the picture. That, see, that's not
                all that buried. And, while we can, we've
                got, I think we've got it buried, there is
                no telling when it's going to pop up. Uh,
                the Cubans, uh, could start this whole
                thing. Uh, when the Ervin Committee starts
                running down why this mysterious telephone
                was here at the White House, uh, listed in
                the name of a secretary, one of these, some
                of these secretaries have a little idea
                about this, and they can be broken down
                Just...
                PRESIDENT: Sure
                DEAN: so fast. That's another thing I missed,
                missed in the cycle, in the circle. Uh,
                Liddy's secretary for example, is
                knowledgeable. Magruder's secretary is
                knowledgeable.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 61
                PRESIDENT: Sure.
                DEAN: Uh...
                PRESIDENT: So Ehrlichman on the, uh...
                DEAN: But what I am coming to you today with is I
                don't have a plan of how to solve it right
                now, but I think it's at the Juncture that
                we should begin to think in terms of, of how
                to cut the losses; how to minimize the
                further growth of this thing; rather than
                further compound it by, you know, ultimately
                paying these guys forever.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: I think we've got to look...
                PRESIDENT: But at the moment, don't you agree that
                you'd better get the Hunt thing? I mean,
                that's worth it, at the moment.
                DEAN: That, that's worth buying time on, right
                PRESIDENT: And that's buying time on, I agree.
                DEAN: Uh, the, the Grand Jury is going to
                reconvene next week after Sirica sentences.
                Uh, but that's why I think that, you know,
                that John and Bob have met with me. They've
                never met with Mitchell on this. We've
                never had a real doom and out with
                everybody, that, uh, has the most to lose.
                And the most, and it is the most danger for
                you to have them have criminal liability. I
                think Bob has a potential criminal
                liability, frankly, I think, in other words,
                a lot of these people could be indicted.
                They might never...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: might never, uh, be convicted; but just the
                thought of
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 62
                PRESIDENT: Suppose...
                PRESIDENT: Suppose that they are indicted in this.
                Suppose...
                DEAN: I think that would be devastating.
                PRESIDENT: Suppose the worst, that Bob is indicted and
                Ehrlichman is indicted. And I must say,
                maybe we just better then try to tough it
                through. You get my point.
                DEAN: That's right. That...
                PRESIDENT: If, if, if, for example, our, uh, our -- say
                well, let's cut our losses and you say we're
                going to go down the road, see if we can cut
                our losses, and no more blackmail and all
                the rest, and the thing blows and they
                indict Bob and the rest. Jesus, you'd never
                recover from that, John.
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: It's better to fight it out instead. You
                see, that's the other thing, the other
                thing. It's better Just to fight it out,
                and not let people testify, so forth and so
                on. Now, on the other hand, we realize that
                we have these weaknesses-- that, uh, (pause)
                we've got this weakness in terms of-(pause)
                blackmail.
                DEAN: It's what, if we, you know, there, there are
                two routes, you know: One is to figure out
                how to cut the losses and, and, and minimize
                the, the human impact and get you up and out
                and away from it, in any way, uh, in, in a
                way that would never come back to haunt.
                Uh, that is one, one general alternative.
                The other is to go (cough) down the road,
                Just hunker doom, fight it at every corner,
                every turn, uh, don't let people testify,
                cover it up is what we're
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 63
                really talking about. Just keep it buried,
                and Just hope that we can do it, hope that
                we make good decisions at the right time,
                and keep our heads cool, uh, Ire make the
                right moves, uh...
                PRESIDENT: And just take the heat.
                DEAN: And just take the heat.
                PRESIDENT: Now, with the second line of attack. You
                discussed this though I do want you to still
                consider my scheme of having y--, you brief
                the Cabinet, Just in very general terms
                (unintelligible}in very general terms, and
                maybe some, some very general statement with
                regard to my-investigation. Answer
                questions, and to, and to basically on the
                question of what they told you, not what you
                know
                DEAN: Right.
                PRESIDENT: Haldeman is not involved. Ehrlichman...
                DEAN: Oh, I can, you know., if, if we go that
                route, sir, I can, I can give a show that,
                you know, there's uh, we can sell, you know,
                Just about like we were selling Wheaties on
                our position. There's no...
                PRESIDENT: The problem that you have are these, uh,
                mine fields down the road. I think the most
                difficult problem is the, are the, are the,
                are the guys that are going to Jail. I
                think you're right about that. I agree.
                Now. And also the fact that we're not going
                to be able to give them clemency.
                DEAN: That's right. How long will they take? How
                long will they sit there? I don't know. We
                don't know, what they’ll be sentenced to.
                There's always a chance...
                PRESIDENT: Thirty years, isn't it? Maximum?
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 64
                DEAN: It could be. You know, they haven't
                announced yet, but it, uh...
                PRESIDENT: Isn't that what the potential is?
                DEAN: Uh, it's even higher than that. It's about
                fifty years, with all the...
                PRESIDENT: So ridiculous.
                DEAN: Oh well, you know, what's so incredible is,
                the, these fellows who, who, sh...
                PRESIDENT: People break and enter, and so forth, and
                get two years.
                DEAN: Well, the other thing...
                PRESIDENT: No, no weapons. No results. What the hell
                are they talking about?
                DEAN: The, the individuals who are charged with
                shooting John Stennis are on the street.
                They were given, you know, uh, one was put
                on his personal recognizance rather than
                bond. They've got these fellows all stuck
                with hundred thousand dollar bonds. The
                same Judge -- Sirica -- let one guy, who,
                who's (laughs) charged with shooting a
                United States Senator, out on the street.
                PRESIDENT: Sirica did?
                DEAN: Yeah. It's just, it's phenomenal.
                PRESIDENT: I thought he was a hardliner Judge.
                DEAN: He's a, he's is Just a, a peculiar animal,
                and uh, he set, set the bond for one of the
                others -- I don't have all the facts, but he
                set the bond for one of the others --
                somewhere around fifty or sixty thousand
                dollars. But still, that guy is in, but
                didn't make bond, but you know, sixty
                thousand dollars as opposed to a hundred
                thousand dollars for these guys is
                phenomenal.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 65
                PRESIDENT: When could you have this meeting Judith
                these fellows, as I think that time is of
                the essence, in my opinion.
                DEAN: (Clears throat)
                PRESIDENT: Could you do it this afternoon?
                DEAN: Well, Mitchell isn't here, and...
                PRESIDENT: Tomorrow?
                DEAN: It might be, might be worth it to have him
                come down. And, now, I think that Bob and
                John did not want to talk to, to John about
                this, John Mitchell. And I don't believe
                they've had any conversations with him about
                it.
                (Loud noises on desk)
                DEAN: Bob and I have talked about just what we're
                talking about this morning. I told him I
                thought that you should have the facts, and
                he agrees. Cause we've got some tough calls
                down the road if we...
                PRESIDENT: Let me say, though that Hunt
                (unintelligible) (dragging noise on desk)
                hard line, and that a convicted felon is
                goings to go out and squeal (unintelligible)
                (dragging noise on desk) as we about this
                (unintelligible) decision (unintelligible)
                turns on that.
                DEAN: Well, we can always, you know, on the other
                side, ore can always charge them with blackmailing us, and it's. you know, this is
                absurd stuff they're saying and... (Pause)
                PRESIDENT: That's right. You see, even the way you put
                it out here, of course if it all came out,
                it may never, it may not never, never get
                there.
                (Haldeman enters the room)
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 66
                (Loud noises on desk)
                PRESIDENT: I was talking to John about this, uh, this
                whole situation, and I think we, uh, so that
                we can get away from the bits and pieces
                that have broken out. He is right in having
                in, in, uh, recommending that, that, uh,
                that there be a meet' no at the very first
                possible time. Ehrlichman, and now
                Ehrlichman's gone on to California but, uh,
                is today, uh, is tomorrow Thursday?
                HALDEMAN: Uh, he John doesn't go until Friday.
                DEAN: Friday...
                PRESIDENT: Well, in any event, could we do it.
                Thursday? This meeting: This meeting you
                can't do it today, can you?
                DEAN: I don't think so. I was suggesting a
                meeting with Mitchell...
                PRESIDENT: Mitchell, Ehrlichman, yourself and Bob'
                that's all. Now, Mitchell has to be there
                because, uh, uh, he is seriously involved
                and, uh, we're trying to keep, uh, we've got
                to see how we, uh, hole we handle it from
                here on. We are in the process of having to
                determine which way to go and, uh, John has
                thought it through, as well as he can. I
                do, I don't want Moore there on this
                occasion.
                DEAN: No.
                PRESIDENT: You haven't told Moore all of this, have
                you?
                DEAN: Moore's got, uh, by being with me, has more
                bits and pieces. I've had to give him
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: because he is making
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 67
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: judgments that, uh...
                PRESIDENT: Well, the point is, once you get down to the
                PR, once you decide what you're going to do,
                then we can let him know, and so forth and
                so on. But it is the kind of thing, I think
                what really has to happen is for you to sit
                down with those three and for you to tell
                them exactly what you told me.
                DEAN: Um huh.
                PRESIDENT: It may take him about thirty-five or fortyfive minutes. In other words he knows,
                John, uh, uh, knows about everything and
                also what all the, uh, what all the
                potential criminal liabilities are, you
                know, whether it's, uh, what's it like that
                thing, what about, uh obstruction ,
                DEAN: Obstruction of justice. Right.
                PRESIDENT: So forth and so on. And, uh, the uh, I
                think, I think that's...Then we've go to,
                uh, see what the line is. Whether the line
                is one of continuing to, uh, run a, try to
                run a total stonewall, and take the heat
                from that, uh, having in mind the fact that,
                uh, there are vulnerable points there; the
                vulnerable points being that, well, the
                first vulnerable points would be obvious.
                In other words, it would be, if, uh, uh, one
                of the, uh, defendants, particularly Hunt,
                of course, who is the most vulnerable my
                opinion, might, uh, blow the whistle, and
                he, he and his price is pretty high, but at
                least, uh, we should, we should buy the time
                on that, uh, as I as I pointed out to John.
                Apparently...Who, who is dealing with Hunt
                at the moment now that
                Colson's(unintelligible) -
                DEAN: Well, uh, Mitchell's lawyer and, uh...
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 68
                PRESIDENT: Colson's lawyer (unintelligible)
                DEAN: Colson's lawyer, both.
                PRESIDENT: familiar with him. Hunt has at least got to
                know before he is sentenced that he's...
                HALDEMAN: Who's Colson's lawyer? (Characterization
                deleted) in his firm?
                DEAN: Shapiro. Right. Who lied to the, you know,
                who just...The other day, he came up and...
                HALDEMAN: Colson's told him everything, hasn't he?
                DEAN: Yup, I gather he has. Uh, the other thing
                that bothered me about that is that he's,
                uh, a chatter. He came up to Fred Fielding,
                of my office, at Colson's going away party.
                I didn't go over there. It was over at the
                Blair House the other night. And he said
                to, uh, Fred, he said, "Well, Chuck has had
                some mighty serious words, with, uh, his,
                his friend Howard and had some mighty
                serious messages back." Now, you know,
                what's a lawyer how does he know what
                Fielding knows? Cause Fielding knows
                virtually nothing. (Laughs)
                PRESIDENT: Well, anyway.
                HALDEMAN: That's, that's where your dangers lie, is in
                all these stupid human errors developing.
                PRESIDENT: That's very...
                DEAN: That's...that's...
                PRESIDENT: Well, the point is, Bob, let's face it, the
                secretaries know, the assistants know.
                There's a lot of the, many of the damn
                principals may be hard as a rock, but you
                never know when they're going to crack.
                But, so, we'll see, we'll see. First you've
                got the Hunt problem. That ought to be
                handled.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 69
                DEAN: Yeah.
                PRESIDENT: Uh, incidentally, I do not think Colson
                should sit in this meeting. Do you agree?
                DEAN: No. I would agree.
                PRESIDENT: Okay. Uh, how then...who does sit and talk
                to Colson? Because somebody has to,
                shouldn't we talk to...
                DEAN: Chuck, uh...
                PRESIDENT: talks too much.
                DEAN: (Sighs) I, I, you know, I like Chuck
                (laughs) but, uh, I don't want Chuck, to
                know anything that I'm doing frankly.
                (Laughs)
                PRESIDENT: All right.
                HALDEMAN: I think that's right. I, I think you want
                to be careful not to give Chuck any more
                knowledge than he's already got.
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: Sure. Well...
                DEAN: I wouldn't want Chuck to even know of the
                meeting, frankly.
                PRESIDENT: Fortunately, fortunately, with Chuck, it is
                very, I, I talk to him about many, many
                political things, but I never talk about
                this sort of thing 'cause he's, uh, he's
                very harmful, I mean I don't think... he
                must be damn sure I don't know anything.
                And I don't. In fact, I'm rather surprised
                at what you told me today. From what you
                said, I gathered the impression, and of
                course, your, your, your analysis does not
                for sure, uh, indicate that Chuck knew that
                it was a bugging operation for certain.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 70
                DEAN: That's correct. 1 don't have...
                PRESIDENT: On the other hand, on the other hand that,
                DEAN: Chuck, Chuck denies that...
                PRESIDENT: on the other hand, the other side of that is
                that Hunt had conversations with Chuck, and
                it may be that Hunt told Chuck that it was
                bugging, and so forth and so on.
                DEAN: Um huh.
                PRESINENT: Is that correct?
                DEAN: Um hum. They were very close. They, they
                talked too much, uh, about too many things.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: They were intimate on this sort of (coughs)
                HALDEMAN: Well then Chuck...
                PRESIDENT: There's another thing you can't...
                HALDEMAN: Chuck has a problem. Chuck loves,
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                HALDEMAN he loves what he does.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                HALDEMAN: He likes to talk about it.
                PRESIDENT: He also is a name dropper. Chuck might have
                gone around and talked to Hunt and said
                "Well, I was talking to the President, and
                the President feels we ought to get
                information about this, or that or the other
                thing," and so forth and so on.
                DEAN: Well, Liddy is the same way, and...
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 71
                PRESIDENT: I have talked to, I have talked to...this
                and that and the other thing. I, I have
                never talked to anybody, but I have talked
                to Chuck and John and the rest and I am sure
                that Chuck may have, Chuck might have even
                talked to Hunt along those lines.
                HALDEMAN: I would...well, anything could happen. I
                would doubt that.
                DEAN: I would doubt that too.
                HALDEMAN: I don't think he would. Uh, Chuck is a name
                dropper in one sense, but not in that sense.
                PRESIDENT: Well, then do you think...
                HALDEMAN: I think he very carefully keeps the
                President out of things. (Noise)
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                HALDEMAN: Except when he's doing it, when he's very
                intentionally bringing the President in for,
                for the President's purposes.
                PRESIDENT: He had the impression though, apparently,
                that he, he was the, as it turns out, really
                is, the trigger man. Uh, may of damn well
                have been the trigger man where he just
                called up and said, "Now look here Jeb, go
                ahead and get that information. And
                (unintelligible) got to be a decision on it
                at that time. This is February.
                DEAN: Yes sir, I figure it was some other...
                PRESIDENT: It must be the...I...it must have been
                after...
                DEAN: This was the call to Magruder from Colson
                saying “Fish or cut bait.” Hunt and Liddy
                were in his office.
                HALDEMAN: In Colson's office?
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 72
                DEAN: In Colson's office. And he called Magruder
                and said, "Let's fish or cut bait on this
                operation. Let's get it going.”
                HALDEMAN: Oh, really?
                DEAN: Yeah. This is...Magruder tells me this.
                HALDEMAN: Of course. That...
                PRESIDENT: Well, on the other hand...
                HALDEMAN: Now wait, Magruder testified
                (unintelligible)
                (Several voices unintelligible)
                DEAN: Chuck, Chuck, also told me that, uh, Hunt
                and Liddy were in his office and he made a
                call.
                HALDEMAN: Oh, okay.
                DEAN: So it did, it was corroborated by the, the
                principal.
                HALDEMAN: Hunt-and Liddy haven't told you that,
                though?
                DEAN: No.
                HALDEMAN: You haven't talked to Hunt and Liddy?
                DEAN: I talked to Liddy once, right after the
                incident.
                PRESIDENT: I'm sorry about that. All right, the point
                is, the point is this, that uh, it's now
                time, though, to, uh, that Mitchell has got
                to sit down, and know where the hell all
                this thing stands too. You see, John is
                concerned, as you know, Bob, about, uh,
                Ehrlichman, which, uh, worries me a great
                deal because it's a. uh, uh, a-, and this
                is why the Hunt problem is so serious, uh,
                because, uh, it-had nothing to do with the
                campaign.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 73
                DEAN: Right, it, uh...
                PRESIDENT: Properly, it has to do with the Ellsberg
                thing. I don't know what the hell, uh...
                HALDEMAN: But why...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah. Why...I don't know.
                HALDEMAN: What I was going to say is...
                PRESIDENT: What is the answer on that? How do you keep
                that out? I don't know. Well, we can't
                keep it out if Hunt..if..you see the point
                is, it is irrevelant. Once it has gotten to
                this point...
                DEAN: You might, you might put it on a national
                security ground basis, which it really, it
                was.
                HALDEMAN: It absolutely was.
                DEAN: And just say that, uh...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: that this is not, you know, this was...
                PRESIDENT: Not paid with CIA funds
                DEAN: Uh...
                PRESIDENT: No, seriously, National security. We had to
                get information for national security
                grounds.
                DEAN: Well, then the question is, why didn't the
                CIA do it or why didn't the FBI do it?
                PRESIDENT: Because they were...we had to do it, we had
                to do it, on a confidential basis.
                HALDEMAN: Because we were checking them?
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 74
                PRESIDENT: Neither could be trusted
                HALDEMAN: Well, I think...
                PRESIDENT: That's the way I view it.
                HALDEMAN: That has never been proven. There was
                reason to question their
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                HALDEMAN: Position
                PRESIDENT: You see really, with the bombing thing and
                everything coming out, the whole thing was
                national security.
                DEAN I think we can probably get, get by on that.
                PRESIDENT: I think on that one, I think you'd simply
                say this was a national security
                investigation that was conducted. And the
                same with the drug field with Krogh. Krogh
                could say I...if Krogh were to
                if(unintelligible) he feels that-he
                perjured(unintelligible) it was a national
                security matter. That's why...
                DEAN: That's the way Bud rests easy, because he's,
                he's, he's convinced that he was doing
                it...he said there was treason about the
                country, and it could have threatened the
                way the war was handled. Uh, and by God...
                PRESIDENT: Bud, Bud said this?
                DEAN: Yes
                PRESIDENT: Well, Bud could say that and say this, it
                does involve...it was a national security
                and I was not in a position to divulge it.
                Well anyway, let's don't go beyond that.
                We're...forget...but I do think now we, uh,
                I mean, there is, there is a time, now when
                you don't want to talk to Mitchell. He
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 75
                CONT: doesn't want to talk, and the rest. But
                John is right. There must be a, must be a
                four way talk here of the particular ones
                that we can trust here. Uh, we've got to
                get a decision on it. It's not something
                that...you see you got two ways, basically.
                There are really only two ways you could go.
                You either decide the whole God damned thing
                is so full of problems with potential
                criminal liability which is what concerns
                me. I don't give a damn about the
                publicity. We could, we could rock that
                through, if we had to let the whole thing
                hang out. It would be a lousy story for a
                month. But I can take it. But the point
                is, I don't want any criminal liability.
                That's the thing that I am concerned about
                for members of the White House staff and I
                would trust for members of the Committee.
                And that means Magruder.
                DEAN: Um.
                PRESIDENT: Let's face it. He's the one that's, uh...
                I think Magruder is the major guy over
                there.
                DEAN: I think he's got the most serious problem.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                HALDEMAN: Well, then we talked about yesterday,
                you've,
                got a, you got a question where your cut off
                point is. There is a possibility of cutting it at Liddy,
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                HALDEMAN: But to accomplish that requires:
                PRESIDENT: Requires what?
                HALDEMAN: Requires continued perjury by Magruder.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 76
                PRESIDENT: Yeah. And it requires total...
                DEAN: commitment...
                PRESIDENT: Control, got total, got total control over
                all of the defendants, which...in other
                words (unintelligible)
                DEAN: The basic position...
                HALDEMAN: They don't know anything, beyond Liddy.
                DEAN: Uh, no. Other than the fact, other 'hen the
                fact that Liddy, they have hearsay, uh...
                HALDEMAN: But we don't know about Hunt. Maybe Hunt
                has it tied in to Colson. We don't know
                that, though really.
                DEAN: No.
                PRESIDENT: I think Hunt knows a hell of a lot more.
                DEAN: Yeah, I do too. And now what McCord...
                HALDEMAN: You think he does? I am afraid you're
                right, but, uh, we don't know that.
                PRESIDENT: I think we better assume it. I think Colson
                DEAN: And he's playing hard ball, and he wouldn't
                play hard...
                HALDEMAN: Is he?
                DEAN: Yeah. He wouldn't play hard ball unless he
                were pretty confident that he could cause an
                awful lot of grief.
                HALDEMAN: Really?
                DEAN: Yeah.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 77
                PRESIDENT: He is playing hard boiled ball with regard
                to Ehrlichman, for example, and that sort of
                thing. He knows what he's got.
                HALDEMAN: What's he planning on, money?
                DEAN: Yeah, money and...
                HALDEMAN: Really
                DEAN: Oh, yeah. He's uh...
                PRESIDENT: It's a hundred and twenty thousand dollars.
                It's about what, about how much, which is
                easy. I mean, it's not easy to deliver, but
                it is easy to get. Uh, now, uh (nine
                seconds of silence) If that, if what, if
                that, if that is the case, if it's Just that
                way, then the thing to do is, if, if, the
                thing all, uh, cracks out...if, if for, if,
                for example, you say look we're not, we're
                not going to continue to try to, let's state
                it frankly...cut our losses...that's just
                one way you could go...on the assumption
                that we're, we, by continuing to cut our
                losses, we're not going to win. That in the
                end, we are going to be bled to death, and
                it's all going to come out anyway, and then
                you get the worst of both worlds. We are
                going to lose and people are going to...
                HALDEMAN: And look (unintelligible)
                PRESIDENT: And we're going to look like we covered up.
                So that we can't do. Now. The other, the
                other, uh, the other line, however, uh, if
                you, if you take that line, that we're not
                going to continue to cut our losses, that
                means then `;e have to look square in the
                eye as to what the hell those losses are,
                and see which people can...so we can avoid
                criminal liability. Right?
                DEAN: That's right.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 78
                PRESIDENT: And that means, we got to, we've got to keep
                it off of you, uh, which I, which I
                (unintelligible) obstruction of Justice
                thing. We've got to keep it off Ehrlichman.
                We've got to keep it, naturally, off of Bob,
                off Chapin, if possible, and Strachan.
                Right?
                DEAN: Um hum.
                PRESIDENT: And Mitchell. Right?
                DEAN: Um hum.
                PRESIDENT: Now.
                HALDEMAN: And Magruder, if you can. But that's the
                one you pretty much have to give up.
                PRESIDENT: But, but Magruder, Magruder, uh, uh, John's,
                Dean's point is that if Magruder goes doyen,
                he'll pull everybody with him.
                HALDEMAN: That's my view.
                PRESIDENT: Is it?
                HALDEMAN: Yup. I think Jeb, I don't think he wants
                to. And I think he even would try not to,
                but I don't think he is able not to.
                DEAN: I don't think he is strong enough, when it
                really...
                HALDEMAN: Well, not that' not that...
                PRESIDENT: Well, another way, another way to do it then
                Bob is to...and John realizes this...is to,
                Pause) uh, continue to try to cut our
                losses. w we have to look at that course of
                action. First, it is going to require
                approximately a million dollars to take care
                of the jackasses that are in jail. That
                could be, that could be arranged.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 79
                HALDEMAN or
                DEAN: Yeah.
                PRESIDENT: That could be arranged. But you realize
                that after we're gone. I mean, assuming
                these (unintelligible) are, they're going to
                crack, you know what I mean? And that'll be
                an unseemly story. Eventually, all the
                people aren't going to care that much.
                DEAN: That's right. It's...
                PRESIDENT: People aren't going to care.
                DEAN: So much history will pass between then and
                now.
                PRESIDENT: In other words, what we're talking about it
                no question. But the second thing is we're
                not going to be able to deliver on, on any
                kind of a, of a clemency thing. You know
                Colson has gone around on this clemency
                thing with Hunt and the rest.
                DEAN: Hunt, Hunt is now talking in terms of being
                out by Christmas.
                HALDEMAN: This year?
                DEAN: This year. Uh, he was told by O'Brien, who
                is my conveyor of doom back and forth...
                HALDEMAN: Yeah.
                DEAN: uh, that, uh, hell, he'd be lucky if he were
                out a year from now, after the Ervin
                hearings were, uh, you know, over. He said,
                "How in the Lord's name could you be
                commuted that quickly?" He said, "Well,
                that's my commitment from Colson."
                HALDEMAN: By Christmas of this year?
                DEAN: Yeah.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 80
                HALDEMAN: See, that, that really, that's very
                believeable cause Colson
                PRESIDENT: Do you think Colson could have told him
                HALDEMAN: Colson is an, is an that's, that's your
                fatal flaw, really, in Chuck, is he is an
                operator in expediency, and he will pay at
                the time and where he is whatever he has to,
                to accomplish what he's there to do. And
                that's...I, I would believe that he has made
                that commitment if Hunt says he has. I
                would believe he is capable of saying that.
                PRESIDENT: The only thing you could do with him would
                be to parole him for a period of time
                because of his family situation. But you
                couldn't provide clemency.
                DEAN: No, I...uh, Kleindienst has now got control
                of the parole board, and he said that now we
                can, we can pull paroles off now where we
                couldn't before. So...
                PRESIDENT: Well, parole...
                HALDEMAN: Yeah, but Kleindienst always tells you that,
                and then never delivers.
                PRESIDENT: Parole, parole. Let's talk candidly about
                that. Parole (unintelligible) in human
                terms, and so forth, is something that I
                think in Hunt's case you could do Hunt, but
                you couldn't do the others. You understand?
                DEAN: Well, so much depends upon hoist Sirica
                sentences. He can sentence, sentence in a
                way that, uh, makes parole even impossible.
                PRESIDENT: Oh, he can?
                DEAN: Sure. He can do all kinds of permanent
                sentences. Yeah. He can be a, just a sonof-a-bitch, uh, as far, as the whole thing.
                (Pause)
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 81
                HALDEMAN: Of course, can't you appeal on a, on an
                unjust sentence, as well as on an unjust
                conviction?
                DEAN: You've got sixty days to ask the Judge to
                review it. There is no appellate review of
                sentences.
                HALDEMAN: There isn't?
                DEAN: Not that I...
                PRESIDENT: The judge can review it, yeah.
                HALDEMAN: Only the sentencing judge can review his own
                sentence?
                PRESIDENT: Coming back, though, to this. So you got
                that...the, uh, hanging over. Now. If, uh,
                you see if you let it hang there, the point
                is you could let all or only part...The
                point is, your feeling is that we just can't
                continue to, to pay the blackmail of these
                guys?
                DEAN: I think that's our greatest jeopardy.
                HALDEMAN: Yeah.
                PRESIDENT: Now, let me tell you, it's
                DEAN: 'Cause that is...
                PRESIDENT: no problem, we could, we could get the
                money. There is no problem in that. We
                can't provide the clemency. The money can
                be provided. Mitchell could provide the way
                to deliver it. That could be done. See
                what I mean?
                HALDEMAN: But, Mitchell says he can't, doesn't he?
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 82
                DEAN: Mitchell says that, uh...well,
                Mitch...that's, it's, you know, there has
                been an interesting thing, uh, phenomena all
                the way along on this, is that there have
                been a lot of people having to pull oars and
                not everybody pulls them all the same time,
                the same way, because their developed selfinterests.
                HALDEMAN: What John is saying is that everybody smiles
                at Dean and says, "Well, you better get
                something done about it."
                DEAN: That's right
                PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)
                HALDEMAN: And Mitch..., Mitchell is leaving Dean
                hanging out on a...None of us, well maybe
                we're doing the same thing to you.
                DEAN: That's right.
                HALDEMAN: But I...let me say that, that I don't see
                how there's any way that you can have the
                White House, or anybody presently in the
                White House, involved in trying to gin out
                of this money.
                DEAN: We are already deeply enough in that.
                That's the problem, Bob.
                PRESIDENT: I thought you said you could handle the
                money?
                DEAN: Well, in fact, that, uh, when...
                PRESIDENT: Kalmbach?
                DEAN: Well, Kalmbach, uh, was a...
                HALDEMAN: He's not the one
                DEAN: No, but when they ran out of that money, as
                you know, they came after the three-fifty
                that was over here.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 83
                PRESIDENT: And they used that, right?
                DEAN: And I had to explain what it was (laughs)
                for, uh, before I could get the money.
                PRESIDENT: Well, you said...
                DEAN: Now, they...now, that...they...
                HALDEMAN: That was put, that was, that was...in the
                first place, that was put back to LaRue.
                DEAN: That's right.
                HALDEMAN: where it belonged. It wasn't all returned
                in a lump sum. It was put back in pieces.
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: And then LaRue used it for this other
                purpose?
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: Well, I think they can get that.
                HALDEMAN: And the balance was all returned to LaRue.
                DEAN: That's right.
                HALDEMAN: The problem is we don't have any receipt for
                that, do we. We have no way of proving
                that.
                (Pause)
                PRESIDENT: I (unintelligible)
                DEAN: And I think, I think that was because, you
                know, of self-interest over there. Mitchell
                should...
                HALDEMAN: Mitchell told LaRue not to take it at all.
                DEAN: That's right.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 84
                HALDEMAN: This is what you told me.
                DEAN: That's right. And then you don't give them
                a receipt.
                PRESIDENT: Well, then, but what happened? LaRue tool
                it, and then what?
                DEAN: Well, it was sent back to him because we
                Just couldn't continue piecemeal giving, you
                know, I ask it...Every time I asked for it,
                I had to tell Bob I needed some, or
                something like that...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah
                DEAN: and he had to get Gordon Strachan to go up
                to his safe and take it out and take it over
                to LaRue.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: This was just a forever operation.
                PRESIDENT: Then what? Why didn't they take it all to
                him?
                DEAN: I think it's sent over with him.
                HALDEMAN: Well, we had been trying to get a way to get
                that money back out of here anyway.
                PRESIDENT: Sure.
                HALDEMAN: And what this was supposed to be was loans.
                This was...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah
                HALDEMAN: immediate cash needs that was going to be
                re..., replenished. And Mitchell was
                arguing "You can't take the three-fifty back
                till it's all replenished." Isn't that
                right?
                DEAN: That' s right. Well--in the, uh...
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 85
                HALDEMAN: And then they never replenished it, so we
                just gave it all back anyway.
                PRENT: I have a feeling we could handle this one.
                Well...
                DEAN: Well, first of all, they'd have a hell of a
                time proving it. Uh, that's one thing.
                Uh...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah, yeah...I just have a feeling on it.
                But let's now come back to the money, a
                million dollars, and so forth and so on.
                Let me say that I think you could get that
                in cash, and I know money is hard, but there
                are ways. That could be (unintelligible).
                But the point is, uh, what would you do on
                that...Let's, let's look at the hard facts.
                DEAN: I mean, that's been very interesting. That
                has been, thus far, the most difficult
                problem.
                PRESIDENT: Why?
                DEAN: They have been that's why these fellows have
                been on or off the reservation all the way
                along.
                PRESIDENT: So the hard place is this. Your, your
                feeling at the present time is the hell with
                the million dollars. In other words, you
                say to these fellows, "I am sorry, it is all
                off," and let them talk. Right?
                DEAN: Well...
                PRESIDENT: That, that's the way to do it, isn't it?
                DEAN: That...
                PRESIDENT: If you want to do it clean (unintelligible)
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 86
                HALDEMAN: See, then when you do it, it's a way you can
                live with. Because the problem with the
                blackmail, and that's the thing we kept
                raising with you `'hen you said there's a
                money problem, when are need twenty thousand
                or a hundred thousand or something, was
                yeah, that's what you need today. But what
                do you need tomorrow and next year and five
                years from now'
                PRESIDEMT: How long?
                DEAN: Well, that was just to get us through
                November seventh, though.
                HALDEMAN: I recognize that's what we had to give
                DEAN: Right.
                HALDEMAN: to November seventh. There's no question.
                DEAN: Except they could have sold...these fellows
                could have sold out to the Democrats for a
                fantastic amount.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah, these fellows but of course, you know,
                these fellows, though, as far as that plan
                was concerned.
                HALDEMAN: But what is there?
                PRESIDENT: As far as what happened up to this time, our
                cover there is just going to be the Cuban
                Committee did this for them up through the
                election.
                DEAN: Well, yeah. We can put that together, That
                isn't, of course, quite the way it happened,
                but, uh...
                PRESIDENT: I know, but it's the way it's going to have
                to happen.
                DEAN: It's going to have to happen.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 87
                PRESIDENT: That's right. Finally, though, so you let
                it go. So what happens is then they go out
                and, uh, and they'll start blowing the
                whistle on everybody else. Isn't that what
                it really gets down to?
                DEAN: Um hum.
                PRESIDENT: So that, that would be the, the clean way,
                Right?
                DEAN: Uh,...
                PRESIDENT: Is that really you're..you, you really go so
                far as to recommend that?
                DEAN: That...no, I wouldn't. I don't think, I
                don't think necessarily that's the cleanest
                way. One of the..I think that's what we all
                need to discuss; is there some way that we
                can get our story before a grand jury, and
                so, that they can have, have really
                investigated the White House on this...I
                mean, and I must, I must be perfectly
                honest, I haven't really thought through
                that alternative. We've been, you know,
                been so busy. (Background noise)
                PRESIDENT: John
                DEAN: on the other containment situation
                PRESIDENT: John Ehrlichman, of course, has raised the
                point of another grand jury. I just don't
                know how you're going to do it. On what
                basis. I, I could call for it, but I...
                DEAN: That would be, I would think, uh...
                PRESIDENT: The President takes the leadership and says,
                "Now, in view of all this, uh, stripped land
                and so forth, I understand this, but I, I
                think I want another grand jury proceeding
                and, and we'll have the White House appear
                before them." Is that right John?
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 89
                DEAN: Uh huh.
                PRESIDENT: That's the point you see. That would make
                the difference. (Noise banging on desk) I
                want everybody in the White House called.
                And that, that gives you the, a reason not
                to have to go up before the (unintelligible)
                Committee. It puts it in a, in an executive
                session in a sense.
                HALDEMAN: Right.
                PRESIDENT: Right.
                DEAN: Uh, well...
                HALDEMAN: And there'd be some rules of evidence.
                aren't there?
                DEAN: There are rules of evidence.
                PRESIDENT: Both evidence and you have lawyers a
                HALDEMAN: So you are in a hell of a lot better
                position than you are up there.
                DEAN: No, you can't have a lawyer before a grand
                jury.
                PRESIDENT: Oh, no. That's right.
                DEAN: You can't have a lawyer before a grand Jury.
                HALDEMAN: Okay, but you, but you, you do have rules of
                evidence. You can refuse to talk.
                DEAN: You can take the Fifth Amendment.
                PRESIDENT: That's right. That's right.
                HALDEMAN: You can say you forgot, too, can't you?
                DEAN: Sure. -
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 89
                DEAN: But you can't...you're...very high risk in
                perjury situation.
                PRESIDENT: That's right. Just be damned sure you say I
                don't...
                HALDEMAN: Yeah...
                PRESIDENT: remember; I can't recall, I can't give any
                honest, an answer to that that I can recall.
                But that's it.
                HALDEMAN: You have the same perjury thing on the Hill,
                don't you?
                DEAN: That’s right.
                PRESIDENT: Oh hell, yes.
                HALDEMAN: And, and they'll be doing things on
                (unintelligible)
                PRESIDENT: My point is, though...
                HALDEMAN: which is a hell of a lot worse to deal with.
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: The grand jury thing has its, uh, uh, uh
                view of this they might, uh. Suppose we
                have a grand jury proceeding. Would that,
                would that, what would that do to the Ervin
                thing? Would it go right ahead any way?
                DEAN: Probably.
                HALDEMAN: If you do it in executive...
                PRESIDENT: But then on that score, though, we
                have...let me Just, uh, run by that,
                that...you do that on a grand jury, we could
                then have a much better cause in terms of
                saying "Look this is a grand jury, in which,
                uh, the prosecutor..." How about a special
                prosecutor? We could use Peterson, or use
                another one. You see he is probably
                suspect. Would you call...
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 90
                DEAN: No.
                PRESIDENT: in another prosecutor?
                DEAN: I'd like to have Petersen on our side,
                advising us (laughs) frankly.
                PRESIDENT: Frankly, well, Petersen is honest. Is
                anybody about to be, question him, are they?
                DEAN: No, no, but he'll get a barrage when, uh,
                these Watergate hearings start.
                PRESIDENT: Yes, but he can go up and say that he's he's
                been told to go further in the Grand Jury
                and go into this and that, and the other
                thing. Call everybody in the White House.
                I want them to come. I leant the, uh, uh,
                to go to the Grand Jury.
                DEAN: This may result...this may happen even
                without our calling for it, when, uh, when
                these, uh...
                PRESIDENT: Vesco?
                DEAN: No. Well, that's one possibility. But
                also, when these people go back before the
                Grand Jury, here, they are going to pull all
                these criminal defendants back in before the
                Grand Jury and immunize them
                PRESIDENT: And immunize them: Why? Who? Are you going
                to...on what?
                DEAN: Uh, the U. S. Attorney's Office will.
                PRESIDENT: To do what?
                DEAN: To talk about anything further they want to
                talk about.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah. What do they gain out of it?
                DEAN: Nothing.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 91
                PRESIDENT: To hell with then.
                DEAN: They, they're going to stonewall it, uh, as
                it now stands. Except for Hunt. That's
                why, that's the leverage in his threat.
                HALDEMAN: This is Hunt's opportunity.
                DEAN: This is Hunt's opportunity.
                PRESIDENT: That's why, that's why...
                HALDEMAN: God, if he can lay this...
                PRESIDENT: that's why your, for your immediate thing
                you've got no choice with Hunt but the
                hundred and twenty or whatever it is.
                Right?
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: Would you agree that that's a buy time
                thing, you better damn well get that done,
                but fast?
                DEAN: I think he ought to be given some signal
                anyway, to, to...
                PRESIDENT Yes.
                DEAN: Yeah...you know.
                PRESIDENT: Well, for Christ's sakes, get it fir, a, in
                a way that, uh (pause) who's, who's going to
                talk to him? Colson? He's the one who's
                supposed to know him.
                DEAN: Well, Colson doesn't have any money though.
                That's the thing. That's been our, one of
                the real problems. They have, uh, been
                unable to raise any money. A million
                dollars in cash, or, or the like, has been
                Just a very difficult problem as we've
                discussed before. Apparently, Mitchell has
                talked to Pappas, and I called him
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 92
                last...John asked me to call him last night
                after our discussion and after you'd met
                with John to see where that was. And I, I
                said, "Have you talked to, to Pappas?" He
                was at home, and Martha picked up the phone
                so it was all in, in code. "Did you talk to
                the Greek?" And he said, uh, "Yes, I have."
                And I said, "Is the Greek bearing gifts?" He
                said, "'tell, I `'ant to call you tomorrow
                on that."
                PRESIDENT: Well, look, uh, what is it that you need on
                that, uh, when, uh, uh? Now look
                (unintelligible) I am, uh unfamiliar with
                the money situation.
                DEAN: Well that, you know it, it sounds easy to
                do, apparently, until, uh, everyone is out
                there doing it and that's where our
                breakdown has, has come every time.
                PRESIDENT: Well, if you had it, where would you, how
                would you get it to somebody?
                DEAN: Well, I, uh, I gather LaRue just leaves it
                in mail boxes and things like that, and
                tells Hunt to go pick it up. Someone phones
                Hunt and tells him to pick it up. As I say'
                we're a bunch of amateurs in that business.
                HALDEMAN: That was the thing that we thought Mitchell
                ought to be able to know holy to find somebody who could do all that sort of thing,
                because none of us know how to.
                DEAN: That's right. You got to wash money and all
                that sort, you know, if you get a hundred
                thousand out of a bank, and it all comes in
                serialized bills, and...
                PRESIDENT: Oh, I understand.
                DEAN: And that means you have to go to Vegas with
                it or a bookmaker in 'few York City, and
                I've learned all these things after the
                fact, it's (laughs) great shape for the next
                time around.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 93
                (Laughter)
                HALDEMAN: Jesus. .
                PRESIDENT: Well, the main point now is, the people who
                will need the money (unintelligible) well of
                course, you've got the surplus from the
                campaign. That we have to -account for.
                But if there's any other money hanging
                around...
                HALDEMAN: Well, but what about all the, what about the
                money we moved back out of the...here?
                DEAN: Apparently, there's some there. That might
                be what they can use. Uh, I don't know how
                much is left.
                PRESIDENT: Kalmbach must have some, doesn't he?
                DEAN: Kalmbach doesn't have a cent.
                PRESIDENT: He doesn't?
                DEAN: See the new law...
                HALDEMAN: No, see that three-fifty that we moved out
                was all we saved. Because they were afraid
                to because of this...that's what I mean;
                that's the trouble. We are so God damned
                square that (laughs) we'd get caught on
                everything.
                PRESIDENT: Well, could I suggest that this though, uh,
                now, let me, let, let me go back around
                (unintelligible) They will then,
                uh...(unintelligible)
                HALDEMAN: Be careful...
                PRESIDENT: The, uh (pause) the grand jury thing has
                appeal. Ouestion is, uh...it, it at least
                says that we are cooperating
                DEAN: Well...
                PRESIDENT: with the Grand Jury.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 94
                DEAN: Once we, once we start doom any route that
                involves the criminal justice system...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: you, you've got to have full appreciation of
                there is really no control over that.
                PRESIDENT: No sir.
                DEAN: Uh, while we did, uh, we had a, an amazing
                job of...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah, I know.
                DEAN: keeping the thing on the track before...
                PRESIDENT: Straight.
                DEAN: while the FBI was out there, all that...and
                that was, uh, only because...
                PRESIDENT: Right
                DEAN: I had a (unintelligible) of where they were
                going.
                PRESIDENT: (unintelligible) Right. Right. But you
                haven't got that now because everybody else
                is going to have a lawyer. Let's take the
                new Grand Jury. Uh, the nest Grand Jury
                would call Magruder again, wouldn't it?
                DEAN: But, based on what information it would?
                For example, what hangers if Dean goes in
                and gives a story, you know, that here is
                the way it all came about. It eras supposed
                to be a legitimate operation and it
                obviously got off the track. I heard of
                these horribles, told Haldeman that we
                shouldn't be involved in it. Then
                Magruder's going to have to be called in and
                questioned about all those meetings again
                and the like. And it begins to... again
                he'll begin to change his story as to what
                he told the Grand Jury the last time.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 95
                PRESIDENT: Well...
                DEAN: That way, he's in a perjury situation.
                HALDEMAN: Except, that's the best leverage you've got
                on Jeb...is that he's got to keep his story
                straight or he's in real trouble.
                DEAN: That's right.
                HALDEMAN: Unless they get smart and give him immunity.
                If they, immunize .Jeb, then you haste an
                interesting problem (pause)
                (Tapping on desk)
                PRESIDENT: He wouldn't
                DEAN: Well, I think we have...
                HALDEMAN: (Unintelligible) immunity
                DEAN: we have control, we have control over who
                gets immunized.
                HALDEMAN: Do we?
                DEAN: Yeah, I think they wouldn't do that without
                our...
                PRESIDENT: But you see, the Grand Jury proceeding
                (unintelligible) sort of thing, you can go
                down that road and then...if...if they
                had...I'm just thinking of now how the
                President looks. We would be cooperating.
                We would be cooperating through the Grand
                Jury. Everybody would be behind us. That's
                the proper way to do this. It should be
                done through a grand jury, not up there in
                the kleig lights of the Committee, or...
                DEAN: That's right.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 96
                PRESIDENT: Nobody's questioning if it's a grand jury,
                and so forth. So, and then we would insist
                on executive privilege before the Committee,
                flat out say, "No we won't do that. We’re
                not going to do it. Matter before a grand
                jury” and that's that. You see...
                HALDEMAN: All right, then you go to the next step.
                Would we then...the Grand Ju.., the Grand
                Jury meet in executive session?
                DEAN: Yes sir, they're...
                PRESIDENT: Always...
                DEAN: secret sessions, they're secret.
                HALDEMAN: Secret session...
                PRESIDENT: Secret...
                HALDEMAN: All right, then would we agree to release
                our statement, our Grand Jury transcripts?
                DEAN: That's not, that's not for our...we don't,
                have the authority to do that. That's up to
                the Court and the Court, thus far, has not
                released the ones from the last Grand Jury.
                PRESIDENT: They usually are not.
                DEAN: It would be highly unusual for a grand fury
                to come out. What should happen is...
                HALDEMAN: But a lot of the stuff from the Grand Jury
                came out.
                PRESIDENT: Leaks. Well...
                DEAN: It came out of the U. S. Attorney's
                Office...
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 97
                DEAN: more than the, the Grand Jury. We don't
                know. Some of the Grand Jurors may have
                leaked...
                PRESIDENT: Right, right.
                DEAN: it, but they were...
                PRESIDENT: Bob, it's not so bad. It's just not the
                bad...or the worst place. But...
                HALDEMAN: Well, what I was. I was going the other way
                there. I was going to...it might be to our
                interest to get it out.
                PRESIDENT: Well, we, we could easily do that. Leak out
                certain stuff. We could pretty much control
                that. We’ve got much more control there.
                Now the other possibility is not to go to
                the Grand Jury. Then you've got three
                things. (1) You Just say, "The hell with
                it, we can't raise the money, sorry Hunt,
                you can say what you want." And so Hunt
                blows the whistle. Right?
                DEAN: Right.
                PRESIDENT: All right, if that happens, then that raises
                some possibilities of other
                criminal...because he is likely to say a
                hell of a lot of things and he's certain to
                get Magruder on it.
                DEAN: It'll get Magruder. It'll start the whole
                FBI investigation going again.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah. So, uh, what else...it'll get
                Magruder, it could possibly get Colson.
                He's in that danger. .
                DEAN: That's right. Could get, uh...
                PRESIDENT: Could get Mitchell. Maybe. No.
                HALDEMAN: Hunt can't get Mitchell.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 98
                DEAN: I don't think Hunt can get Mitchell. Hunt's
                got a lot of hearsay.
                PRESIDENT: Ehrlichman? He could on the other
                thing...except Ehrlichman (unintelligible)
                DEAN: Krogh, Krogh could go down in smoke. Uh...
                PRESIDENT: Because Krogh, uh...where could anybody
                ...but on the other hand, Krogh, just says
                he, uh, uh, Krogh says this is a national
                security matter. Is that what he says?
                Yeah, he said that.
                DEAN: Yeah, but that won't sell, ultimately, in a
                criminal situation. It may be mitigating on
                sentences but it won't, uh, in the main
                matter...
                HALDEMAN: Well, then that...
                PRESIDENT: That's right. Try to look around the track.
                We have no choice on Hunt but to try to keep
                him...
                DEAN: Right now, we have no choice.
                PRESIDENT: But, but my point is, do you ever have any
                choice on Hunt? That's the point.
                DEAN: (Sighs)
                PRESIDENT: No matter what we do here now, John...
                DEAN: Well. if we...
                PRESIDENT: Hunt eventually, if he isn't going to get
                commuted and so forth, he's going to bloat
                the whistle.
                DEAN: What I have been trying to conceive of is
                how we could lay out everything we know
                (sighs) in a way that, you knows we've told
                the Grand Jury or somebody else, so that if
                a Hunt blows...
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 99
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN so what's new? You know, it's already been
                told to a grand Jury, and they found no
                criminal liability, and they investigated it
                in full. We're sorry fellow...
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: Uh, we don't, it doesn't...
                PRESIDENT: Including Ehrlichman's use of Hunt on the
                other deal?
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: You'd throw that out?
                DEAN: Uh, well, Hunt will go to jail for that
                too...he's got to understand that.
                PRESIDENT: That's the point too. I don't think that
                ...I wouldn't throw that out. I think I
                would limit it to...I don't think you need
                to go into every God damned thing Hunt has
                done
                DEAN: No.
                PRESIDENT: He's done some things in the national
                security area. Yes, true.
                HALDEMAN: We've already said that. Anyway, I mean,
                we've laid the ground work for that.
                DEAN: Uh huh.
                PRESIDENT: But here is the point, John: So you go
                that...let's go to the other extreme, the
                other, the other angle is to decide on,
                well, if you open up the Grand Jury, first,
                it won't do any good; it won't be believed.
                And then you'll have two things going: The
                Grand Jury and you have the other thing. At
                least the Grand Jury appeals to
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 100
                me from the standpoint, it's the President
                makes the move. "Since all these charges
                have been bandied about, and so forth, the
                best thing to do is to...I have ordered, or
                I have asked the Grand Jury to look into any
                further charges. All charges have been
                raised." That's the place to do it and not
                before a committee of the Congress. Right?
                DEAN: Um hum.
                PRESIDENT: Then, however, we may say, Mitchell, et al.,
                God we can't risk that, I mean, uh, all
                sorts of shit'll break loose there. Then
                that leaves you to your third thing. The
                third thing is just to continue to...
                DEAN: Hunker down and fight it.
                PRESIDENT: All right. If you hunker down and fight it,
                fight it and what happens?
                DEAN: Your...
                PRESIDENT: Your view is that, that is, is not really a
                viable option.
                DEAN: It's a veryit's a high risk. A very high risk.
                PRESIDENT: A high risk, because your view is that what
                will happen out of that is that it's going
                to come out.
                Somebody's...Hunt...something's going to
                break loose...
                DEAN: Something is going to break and...
                PRESIDENT: When it breaks it'll look like the President
                DEAN: ...is covering up...
                REEL 2 ENDS
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 101
                REEL 3 BEGINS
                DEAN: Your...
                PRESIDENT: Your view is that that is, is not really a
                viable option.
                DEAN: In fact, it's a high risk. A very high
                risk.
                PRESIDENT: A high risk, because your view is that what
                will happen out of that is that it's going
                to come out.
                Somebody's...Hunt...something's going to
                break loose...
                DEAN: Something is going to break and...
                PRESIDENT: When it breaks it'll look like the
                President...
                DEAN: ...is covering up...
                PRESIDENT: is, has covered up a huge, uh, uh, this -
                Right?
                DEAN That's correct.
                HALDEMAN: But you can't contain the charge.
                PRESIDENT: That's not...
                 (Noise)
                DEAN: I just don't...
                PRESIDENT: You're, you're
                DEAN: I don't think it's...
                PRESIDENT: You now have, uh, moved away from the hunker
                down.
                (Noise)
                DEAN: Well, I've moved to the point that we've
                certainly got to take a, a harder look at
                the other alternative, which we haven't
                before.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 102
                PRESIDENT: The other alternatives.
                DEAN: The other alternatives. Right
                PRESIDENT: Three other choices, wouldn't you say? As a
                matter of fact, your m-, middle ground of
                Grand Jury. And then there's finally the on
                ground of -- No, I suppose there's a middle
                ground.
                DEAN: And I would -
                PRESIDENT: or the middle grounds of a public statement,
                without a Grand Jury.
                DEAN: What we need also, sir -
                PRESIDENT: And also -
                HALDEMAN: But John's view is if we make the public
                statement
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                HALDEMAN: that we talked - I raised that this morning,
                the, the thing we talked about last night.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                HALDEMAN: If each of us
                PRESIDENT: Yeah
                HALDEMAN: make moves,
                PRESIDENT: Yeah
                HALDEMAN: He says that will immediately lead to a
                Grand Jury.
                PRESIDENT: Fine - all right, fine.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 103
                HALDEMAN: As soon as we make that statement, they'll
                have to call a Grand Jury.
                PRESIDENT: Then maybe we make the public statement
                before the Grand Jury, in order to -
                HALDEMAN: So it looks like we are trying to do it
                over.
                DEAN: All right, say all right, say here are
                public statements, and we want, we want, uh,
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                DEAN: full Grand Jury investigation
                PRESIDENT: Yeah
                DEAN: by the U. S. Attorney's Office
                PRESIDENT: Curious to see whether this statement's,
                then, that’s right. That I, but - And that
                we’ve said that the reason that we had
                delayed this is until after the sentencing.
                You see, the point is, the reason that time
                is of the essence, we can't play around with
                this, is that they're going to sentence on
                Friday. We're going to move the God damned
                thing pretty fast. See what I mean?
                DEAN: That's right.
                (Pause)
                PRESIDENT: So we've got to act, we really haven't time
                to (unintelligible)
                DEAN: The other, the other thing is that the
                Attorney General could call Sirica, and say
                that. "The Government has some major
                developments that it's considering. Would
                you hold sentencing for two weeks?" If we
                set ourself on a course of action.
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 104
                PRESIDENT: Yep, yep.
                DEAN: Say, that "The sentencing may be in the
                wrong perspective right now. I don't know
                for certain, but I just think there are some
                things that ? uh, I am not at liberty to
                discuss with you, that I want to ask that
                the, the court withhold two weeks
                sentencing.”
                HALDEMAN: So then the story is out: "Sirica Delays
                Sentencing Watergate For --"
                DEAN: I think, I think that could be handled in a
                way between Sirica and Kleindienst that it
                would not get out.
                PRESIDENT: No.
                DEAN: Sirica tells me, I mean Kleindienst
                apparently does-have good rapport with
                Sirica. He's never talked to him since this
                case has developed,
                HALDEMAN or
                PRESIDENT: Why not?
                DEAN: but, uh -
                PRESIDENT: That's helpful. Kleindienst could say that
                he's, uh, he's working on something and
                would like, like, like to have a week. I
                wouldn't take two weeks. I would take a
                week.
                DEAN: I'll tell you the person that I would, you
                know, I feel that, uh, we' we could use his
                counsel on this, because he understands the
                criminal process better than anybody over
                here does,
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 105
                PRESIDENT: Petersen?
                DEAN: is Petersen. It, it's awkward for Petersen.
                He's the head of the Criminal Division. But to discuss so
                related to this case, you will have no relation." Uh, and
                proved," or so on and so forth. We almost
                need him out of there to take his counsel. That would, uh
                PRESIDENT: How could you get him out?
                DEAN: I think an appeal directly to Henry, uh,
                that uh
                PRESIDENT: Why doesn't the President - could, could the
                President call him in as Special Counsel to
                the White - to the, to the White House for the purpose of
                DEAN: I have thought of that. I have thought of
                that.
                PRESIDENT: have him as Special Counsel to represent to
                the Grand Jury and the rest.
                DEAN: That is one possibility.
                PRESIDENT: Yeah.
                HALDEMAN: On the basis that Dean has now become a
                principal rather than a Special Counsel.
                DEAN: Uh huh.
                RCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 106
                PRESIDENT: That's right.
                DEAN: Uh huh.
                PRESIDENT: And that he's a --
                DEAN: And I, and I could recommend that to you.
                PRESIDENT: He could recommend it, you could recommend
                it, and Petersen would come over and be the,
                uh - and I'd say, "Now --"
                HALDEMAN: Petersen's planning to leave, anyway.
                PRESIDENT: And I'd say, "Now,"
                DEAN: Is he?
                HALDEMAN: Yep--
                PRESIDENT: "I want you to get - we want you to (1) -"
                We'd say to Petersen, "We want you to get to
                the bottom of the God damned thing, Call
                another Grand Jury or anything else."
                Correct? Well, now you've got to follow up
                to see whether Kleindienst can get Sirica to
                put off - Right? If that is, if we -
                Second, you've got to get Mitchell down
                here. You and Ehrlichman and Mitchell and
                let's - an - by tomorrow.
                HALDEMAN: Why don't we do that tonight?
                PRESIDENT: I don't think you can get him that soon, can
                you?
                HALDEMAN: John?
                PRESIDENT: It would be helpful if you could.
                DEAN: I think it would be.
                PRESIDENT: You need --
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 107
                DEAN: Get him to cone down this afternoon.
                PRESIDENT: It would be very helpful to, to get it
                going. And, uh, uh, you know, and, uh, and
                then, uh - Actually, uh, I'm perfectly
                willing to meet with the group, or I don't
                know whether -
                HALDEMAN: Do you think you want to?
                PRESIDENT: Maybe have Dean report to me at the end, as
                to what are, as to what conclusions, et
                cetera what you want to do. I thing I
                should stay away from the Mitchell side of
                it at this point.
                DEAN: Ih huh.
                PRESIDENT: Do you agree?
                DEAN: Uh huh.
                PRESIDENT: and, uh -
                DEAN: And I think, unless we see, you know, some
                sort of a reluctant dragon there --
                HALDEMAN: You might try to meet with the rest of us,
                I, I'm, I'm not sure you'd want to meet with
                John in a group of us. (Noise) (Pause)
                Okay, let me see if I can get it done.
                PRESIDENT: All right. Fine. That's it, my point is
                that' uh, we can, uh, you may well come - I
                think it is good (noise) frankly, to
                outsider these various options. And then,
                once you, once you decide on the plan - John
                - and you had the right plan, let me say, I
                have no doubts about the right plan before
                the election. And you handled it just
                right. You contained it. - Now after the
                election we've got to have another plan,
                because we can't have, for four years,
                MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M. 108
                PRESIDENT:
                Cont: we can't have this thing - you're going to
                be eaten away. We can't do it
                DEAN: -Well, there's been a change-in the mood
                HALDEMAN: John's point is exactly right, that the
                erosion here now is going to you, and that
                is the thing that we've got to turn off, at
                whatever the cost and we've got to figure
                out where to turn it off at the lowest cost
                we can, but at whatever cost it takes.
                DEAN: That's what, that's what we have to do.
                PRESIDENT: Well, the erosion is inevitably going to
                come here, apart from anything, you know,
                people saying that, uh' well, the Watergate
                isn't a major concern. It isn't. But it
                would, but it will be. It's bound to be.
                DEAN: We cannot let you be tarnished by that
                situation.
                PRESIDENT: Well, I (unintelligible) also because I
                Although Ron Ziegler has to go out -They
                blame the (unintelligible) on the White
                House (unintelligible)
                DEAN: That's right.
                PRESIDENT: We don't, uh, uh, I say that the White House
                can't do it. Right?
                HALDEMAN: Yeah.
                DEAN: Yes. sir.</p>
