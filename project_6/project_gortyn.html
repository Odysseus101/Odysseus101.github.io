            will just be greek metholigy. the game borows from pokemon, final fantasy, undertale.

            <h1>Logbook</h1>
            <h2>02/12/2019</h2>
            <p>I started with a Specific goal in mind. I wanted to re-create the fun I’ve had playing RPG´s. where you could follow the main story and customize it to your own will by giving 
            <br>your companion names and playing different routes like pacifist, fighter or nothing matters. So, I started making sprites when I got them done I put them all into unity and 
            <br>sliced them.</p><br>
            <h2>03/12/2019</h2>
            <p>Today I created more sprites but for the battle scene I made a minotaur and medusa</p>
            <h2>04/12/2019</h2>
            <p>I created a basic movement left and right, but couldn’t make more</p>
            <h2>05/12/2019</h2>
            <p>I deleted my Basic movement function so a could make a more advanced function and tried to make him shoot arrows and i made a dynamic grass tile set so when the maze builds the grass tiles match</p>
            <h2>06/12/2019</h2>
            <p>couldn’t work on the project today because of personal reasons</p>
            <h2>07/12/2019</h2>
            <p>I found a script that creates random patterned maze and I’m trying to integrate it with the sprites I’m using</p>
            <h2>08/12/2019</h2>
            <p>Today I continued trying to but didn’t get it to work because the sprits aren’t compatible</p>
