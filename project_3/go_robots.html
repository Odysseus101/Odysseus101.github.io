            If you’ve been on the internet recently you might have come across the above tweet, showing a robot with a CCTV camera for a head doing some half-hearted pole-dancing. It’s a good tweet! It captures a bunch of extremely 2017 feelings, including dystopia, fear of job automation, and the general mood of absurdity that’s going around a lot. Plus, you know, it’s a pole-dancing robot. But, as a famous philosopher once asked: why is this robot pole dancing? To what end? Well it turns out it’s art, but there’s a bit more to it than that. The robot is actually the creation of UK artist Giles Walker, who made the bot back in 2008. There are actually two pole-dancing robots, and a third companion that’s supposed to be DJ-ing. (It has a megaphone for a head instead of a camera.) But, as Walker explains to The Verge, the bots aren’t really supposed to be a commentary on robotics or job automation. They’re about surveillance. “At the time [when I made them], they were putting CCTV cameras up all around London, and Britain was becoming the most surveilled society in the world,” says Walker. “So I was playing with this idea of voyeurism, and who has the power in that relationship; whether it’s the voyeur or the person being watched.” He adds that there was a lot of discussion in the news at the time about the “sexed up” Iraq dossier — a document published by the British government examining the existence of WMDs in Iraq, which a source later said had been exaggerated. “So I was just playing with the idea that if a document could be sexed up, maybe CCTV cameras could be as well,” says Walker. “That’s how I got to these mechanical peeping toms. It was a mingling of all those things.” Since their creation, the robots have taken on a life of their own. Pictures and videos of them resurface online every now and again, and Walker hires them out to tech conferences, festivals, and other events. (They cost around £1,000 a day or $1,343.) And although they look straight out of a sci-fi B-movie, the bots aren’t technologically complex. They’re made from shop mannequins and are powered by windscreen wiper motors, with their movements controlled by short, pre-defined loops. “At that time I built all my stuff out of scrap and found objects,” says Walker. “So not much tech in there. It’s really old school.” Walker’s other projects include Breakdown Clown (an animatronic sculpture that monologues while its speech patterns slowly degenerate); The Last Supper (a group of 13 sculptures that talk, argue, and smoke around a table); and a series of “homeless” robot sculptures placed in cities as guerrilla art. As pieces of art that might show up at a tech conference, though, the pole-dancing robots feel dated in 2017. The tech industry is only just beginning to come to terms with its long history of ingrained sexism and discrimination, and some people might see sexualized robots at a tech fair as an example of the bro culture that has, in part, contributed to these problems. Walker didn’t create the robots with these issues in mind, but says he’d think twice before making them again. He says the rise of “sexbots” particularly has given the sculptures new connotations. “These are meant to be a play on voyeurism, but because of the sexbot thing they’ve taken on a slightly menacing touch,” he says. Despite that, though, they’re still touring, and Walker has no plans to stop. “They’re the most popular thing I’ve done,” he says. “Like a sort of Christmas jingle. They’ve become iconic.”

            “It was a cold day in October, the 11th I remember the day like it was yesterday, if only it was yesterday then I wouldn’t be sitting in front of you telling you what had happened” I said sitting in a nice chair in a quiet office. The silence was deafening, leaving me to only watch him nod quietly simply holding his pen to his chin and judging me. Judging me like she did, it was happening all over again, the feels that I have that push me over the edge to where she arrived and I returned to the darkness just waiting there while she finished showing the world who she was. I looked down to avoid eye contact, biting my lip, not hard but enough to distract me from the awkward judgmental stare I was getting. “Go on Sam go on” he said after what seemed like 20 minutes. Yes that was me, Sam, Samantha Sayors. A girl from Crawford, Georgia age 17, a psychopathic girl stuck in the Behavioral Institute, of Athens-Clark County for the rest of my life. “Go on Sam you can tell me, we all know what you said, I just need you to tell me again. Who knows it could all help getting it off of your chest” he pushed on leaning forward resting his chin on his arms and his elbows on his knees. I looked to him through my hair which hasn’t been brushed in weeks I saw no point in doing it, who would come to see me anyways, my mother? She hates me, more ashamed then angry I ruined her perfect country reputation. He burned holes through me with his eyes, talking to me without saying a word he is the tiger and my story is his prey, was he trying to murder it and abolish it from me for his status to the state, or earn money through the fact that he “cured” the murderer of Georgia. I leaned back a little attempting to show my face a little with out showing I’m giving into his little society of the lion tamers. Though giving him the truth of my story gives everyone the judgment that I’m jumping into the fire pit to allow my ashes to be blown away the next day later, no, that was not my plan, my plan was to jump into the fire pit for the next wind to blow me away and poison the air a little at a time. I carried on with my story, starting from the beginning. It was a cold day in October. It was October 11th to be exact and I was in the car it was starting to sprinkle as I stared out the window. “Sam it’s for your own good. Maybe then you’d stop going through this little depressed phase” my mother nagged I didn’t want to listen to this anymore, I’ve heard it so many times the same thing over and over again. Only because she was the perfect woman and that was the last thing she needed was to have a daughter following in her fathers foot steps, the dead beat dad who runs from his problems and goes into hiding, she didn’t need that to ruin her perfect reputation. Blonde hair blue eyes and a size 26 waist, perfect body shape, perfect reputation perfect accent everyone loved her. Then there was me, the over dramatic one brown hair brown eyes, the eyes of everyone and the voices to go along with it pressuring me to follow in my mothers foot steps. I simply rolled my eyes, knowing that it’d be easier for the both of us if I just didn’t say anything. It’s not depression, it’s just I didn’t feel anything, it was just that I didn’t feel the need to try, there was honestly no point. I sat back and looked at the ceiling tired of the boring scene dancing outside my window. We arrived at the school, a giant prison ironic because most of the prisoners were happy to see each other and amused to arrive at this building while the others seemed to have felt the same as me rebelling against the fist of their parents as best as they could to veto the life of being locked up like little robots being trained to be sent off into the world to just be trained to die a over seen hard worker. But they only rebel with silence knowing there was no point only to rebel a little at a time to make them realize that they can not stop us, we are the next generation and the silenced voices will be heard whether they liked it or not. This made me realize my head but then my mother caught my eye, putting on her murderous lipstick on, the red was my favourite colour, it may have been lighter then crimson but it was still red and I just adored it, only because it rejects me. It was a forbidden love which made me love it even more. My mother eyes me to get out the car and I did it slowly giving her time to fix her make up. She stood up and fixed her pencil skirt. She trotted to the door catching the eyes of devilish teenage boys who just looked away in shame that I was the ugly duckling to follow this swan goddess. I hung my head in shame to know that these humans could not accept someone unless death was holding them in a choke hold or a hog had money tied to her tail running them useless.

        It was a late Friday night at the nightclub downtown. Me and my friend Chris, who was visiting from Europe, or as he calls it 'the other side of the world’ had just downed a shot of some drink he got us after hearing the DJ saying 'last call.’<div><img src="" alt=""></div> To say that we were wasted would be an understatement as myself and Chris we’re bouncing off thanks like pinballs desperately trying to make it outside. We had finally made it outside and I know I sound really stupid or crazy for saying this, but being outside was extremely different from being inside. Where as the inside of the nightclub had vibrant colors, loud music, people dancing and an overall warm and pleasurable atmosphere, the streets were dark, muted, cold, and barren of any life outside the club. As I swayed from side to side, I asked Chris, in a slurred speech, for his phone since mine was dead. He looked at me for a minute with an expression that signaled to me that he couldn’t make out a single word I said then proceeded to vomit chunks on my shoes. Now, any other day I would of socked him, but at the moment I just wanted to pass out on my bed; So I went into his pocket and pulled out his phone. I shook my head in both disbelief and disappointment when I saw the screen, no signal. As I began thinking of scenarios of myself and Chris sleeping by an alleyway or on the streets, I saw a woman wearing a short red dress leaning against the nightclub wall. She had her long blonde hair in a ponytail and was looking down at her phone. I could hear myself saying to ask her for her number and if there ever was a time to be 'that drunk guy' it was then, it could of helped in such a way that no words could explain, but I was t i r e d, and reeked of puke, so I decided not to; I mean what girl would actually give her number to a guy in my condition. I had laid Chris by the wall of the nightclub and made my way to the woman, wobbling with each and every step. When I had finally approached the woman, I tried, with all my might, to stand up straight up and ask to use her phone. The woman didn’t move, as if she didn’t even noticed me. A bit paranoid that her boyfriend or company would come outside and get the wrong idea of me, I tapped her shoulder and asked again. She quickly shifted her attention from her phone to me, like she was some sort of robot. It took me by surprise as I took a step back from her in shock. “Hey, sorry to bother you, but me and my friend phones are dead, can I use your phone to call a cab?” The woman nodded and said ‘yea sure,' before handing me her phone. As I strained my eyes to dial the cab company, I could faintly see the woman glaring at her phone. It was a bit unsettling, but understandable giving my condition. I called the cab company, told them my location and hung up the call. I felt a sense of relief as the cab company said the they had a driver nearby and that he would be here in 10 mins. Before I handed the woman back her phone, a message popped up on the screen. I opened the message, thinking that it was my phone and saw an image that made itself home in my nightmares. It was an image of a man, beaten, battered and mutilated beyond all recognition attached with the text, 'beat that' I immediately gave the woman back her phone and rushed to Chris, who was slumped against the wall. I told him that a cab was on the way here and decided to sit beside him. I didn’t take my eyes off of the woman at all, fearing the possible outcome if I did. The woman didn’t make any eye contact to me, or even to my direction, she just stared at her phone quietly. The rest of that night was a blur as I woke up on my bed the next morning with the same clothes I had on. Confused, I called Chris to check up on him and maybe find out what happened while we were waiting for the cab, no answer. Worried, I kept calling his phone over and over, leaving messages like 'dude call me back ASAP!' I then called the cab company to get some answers and what I was told made my heart sink 10 feet. The cab company said that a woman in a red dress paid for my fare to get home and left with a man whose description matched Chris exactly. I reached out to Chris family to see if they heard anything from him since last night and when they told me no, I immediately called the police and told them everything, I then packed my car with everything that would fit and left my house, never looking back. It’s been a few years since that night, since I last saw or heard from Chris. There isn’t a single night that goes by where I don’t think about that woman and ask myself before scaring myself with haunting thoughts, ‘how did that woman know my address….and for how long?'
